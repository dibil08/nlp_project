Impacts of visitors on cave’s physical environment and its protection 
Abstract Studies of impacts on caves usually cover the topics of water pollution, 
microclimate, lampenflora and cave biota. In this thesis, the impacts of different 
types of visitors on caves’ physical environments are presented. They accumulate in 
caves and reduce their scientific (i.e. they “erase” important information on the 
development of caves and the surface above) and aesthetic values. 
People have been using the caves in the Classical Karst for different purposes 
since prehistoric times. They served as shelters, hiding places; they were used for 
cult purposes, for storage (weapons, explosives, refuse dumps and waste water) and the exploitation of natural resources (karst springs, ice, etc.). Since the 17th century, 
the caves have predominantly been used for tourist and speleological purposes. The 
region and its natural phenomena have gained international importance as a result of 
speleological explorations, and the developments of tourism, and karstology as a 
science. However, the long and intense use of caves, particularly in the previous two 
centuries, has also had significant impacts on the physical environment of caves. 
The impacts of visitors were studied in 24 caves. The caves were divided in 
the following groups: show caves, well-known caves, less-known caves and easily 
accessible caves. The results show that physical environment has been significantly 
damaged in several caves. 
One of the most evident impacts are broken speleothems, although it seems 
that this habit has become less popular and there are no signs of new damage. Off- 
trail footprints affect mainly fine sediments and are very frequent in all caves. The 
impacts in caves are the most profound due to infrastructure works and visitors. 
Lampenflora is one of the most visible effects in the majority of the visited caves 
(Postojnska jama, Škocjanske jame and Grotta Gigante (Velika jama v Briščikih)). It 
is also possible to find litter and other types of waste in caves. The most common 
waste left in caves by cavers is carbide. There are almost no new carbide dumps due 
to increased awareness among cavers and the use of electric lamps in the previous 10 
years. Graffiti appear in almost all the caves, only the newly explored caves are 
“clean”. The big graffiti made by paint, carbide lamp soot or cutting began to appear 
after 1920. It is only since 1990 that graffiti have become less frequent. It is also 
possible to notice the significant impacts of scientists who took samples of flowstone 
i 
formations, archaeological excavations, etc. In the caves that have recently been 
explored and have controlled access, the impacts are minor. 
Although most of the damage has been accumulating, there have already been 
some actions by cavers and staff of the show caves to reduce the impacts, such as 
cleaning waste from caves, placing trail markers and equipping frequently visited 
caves, gating caves, cleaning graffiti, bringing in new clothing and footwear to wear 
in unspoilt areas of cave, etc. 
The Classical Karst has been one of the most important karst regions for 
speleological explorations, scientific research and tourism throughout history and 
today. The damage done in caves should be repaired and our best efforts to explore 
the underground passages with minimal impacts should be made. It would also be 
necessary to discuss the protection of karst caves within complex geosystems. As 
caves form a part of a complex karst geosystem, they are reached by pollutants from 
the surrounding environment. So it is not enough to protect only a cave itself; 
attention should also be given to other influences 
Key words:

Vplivi obiskovalcev na jamsko fizično okolje in njegovo varovanje 
Izvleček Študije vplivov na jamsko okolje navadno zajemajo onesnaţevanje vode, 
spremembe mikroklime, razraščanje alg in mahov (lampenfloro) ter jamsko 
ţivalstvo. V doktorski disertaciji so obravnavani vplivi različnih kategorij 
obiskovalcev na jamsko fizično okolje. Ti se v jamah akumulirajo, so dolgotrajni ter 
zmanjšujejo znanstveno (velikokrat se zabrišejo pomembne informacije o nastanku 
jam in razvoju površja) in estetsko vrednost jam. 
Problematiko smo obravnavali na jamah Klasičnega Krasa, ki imajo bogato 
zgodovino, saj človek prihaja vanje ţe od prazgodovine, in sicer so zanj (bile) 
zavetišča in skrivališča, kultni prostor, odlagališča ali skladišča (na primer za 
eksploziv, oroţje, odpadke in odpadne vode) ali nahajališče naravnih virov (na 
primer vode ali ledu). Od 17. stoletja sta najbolj uveljavljeni obliki rabe turizem in 
speleologija. Obravnavana regija je postala svetovno znana zaradi jamarskih 
raziskav, razvoja turizma in krasoslovja kot znanstvene panoge. Raba jam, ki je zlasti 
intenzivna v zadnjih dveh stoletjih, je negativno vplivala na jamsko fizično okolje. 
V doktorski disertaciji je obravnavanih 24 jam, ki so razdeljene v štiri 
skupine, in sicer so to: turistične jame ter bolj znane, manj znane in lahko dostopne 
jame. Rezultati kaţejo, da je fizično okolje v nekaterih jamah precej poškodovano. 
Ena najvidnejših poškodb so polomljeni kapniki. Kaţe pa, da se je 
ozaveščenost na tem področju povečala, saj ni več veliko sledov, ki bi pričali, da 
obiskovalci še vedno lomijo kapnike. Značilne so tudi poškodbe na drobnem 
jamskem sedimentu (na primer na jamskih ilovicah), to so predvsem odtisi 
obiskovalcev. Najbolj poškodovane so turistične jame, v katerih so zlasti vidni 
zgrajena turistična infrastruktura, odpadki obiskovalcev in odpadna infrastruktura; v 
najbolj obiskanih turističnih jamah (Postojnska jama, Škocjanske jame in Velika 
jama v Briščikih) je poleg turistične infrastrukture najočitnejši element degradacije 
lampenflora. Ena vidnejših sledi jamarjev v jamah je karbidno apno, čeprav ni več 
zaznati novejših karbidnih ostankov, predvsem zaradi večje ozaveščenosti jamarjev 
in uporabe električnih svetilk v zadnjih desetih letih. Grafiti se pojavljajo v vseh 
jamah, razen v novoodkritih. Veliki grafiti, narejeni z barvami, acetilenskim 
plamenom ali klesani, so se začeli pojavljati po letu 1920, trend zmanjševanja pa je 
opazen po letu 1990. Značilne poškodbe, ki jih v jamah povzročajo znanstveniki, so 
iii 
predvsem rezanje sige, jemanje vzorcev sedimentov za analize in arheološka 
izkopavanja. Veliko manjše so poškodbe v jamah, ki so odkrite na novo. 
Čeprav se škoda v jamah akumulira, so poznani primeri dobrih praks 
jamarjev in upravljavcev turističnih jam za zmanjševanje negativnih vplivov, na 
primer odstranjevanje odpadkov, označevanje poti in opremljanje za jamarske 
raziskave, postavljanje vrat, odstranjevanje grafitov, uporaba čistih oblačil in obutve 
v »čistih« predelih jam ipd. 
Klasični Kras je bil in je še vedno eno najpomembnejših kraških območij za 
speleološke raziskave in razvoj turizma. Zato si zasluţi, da se škoda v jamah popravi 
in da so vplivi obiskovanja podzemnega sveta čim manjši. Poleg tega pa je jame 
treba obravnavati širše, v tako imenovanem geosistemu. Ker je jama del zapletenega 
kraškega geosistema in vanjo prodirajo onesnaţevala iz okolja, je zgolj njena zaščita 
premalo. Vsekakor je treba obravnavati tudi zunanje vplive. 
Ključne besede: 
Klasični Kras, Kras, raba jam, vplivi obiskovalcev na jamsko fizično okolje

Part I – Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION 
The study of caves and their content (such as speleothems, fine sediment, 
rock surface, etc.) is usually based on the environmental sciences, such as study of 
geology, hydrology, sediments, climate, morphology, speleogenesis, flora and fauna. 
Especially in recent years there is an important part of research the topic of 
cave protection. Until now the studies of karstologists were mainly based on cave 
protection from pollution from the surface in the field of hydrology and biology. 
Studies of visitors’ impacts have been focused mainly on measurements of CO2 and lampenflora. On the other hand there is a much more important influence on the 
morphology of the cave directly from visitors, such as footprints, soiled and broken 
formations, graffiti, etc. That kind of damage can be seen and often it cannot be 
repaired only by natural processes in caves. 
The core area of the study is the Classical Karst – Kras where the pioneer cave explorations began in the 19th century. As this area is rich in caves and 
especially their accessibility and the abundance of cave content it is here where the 
pressures on caves are high. 
As the number of caves is high and also their variety, only a few caves are 
presented as examples and only a few were chosen as case studies. Predominantly 
caves in Slovenia were chosen, with the exception of Abisso di Trebiciano 
(Labodnica) and Grotta Gigante (Velika jama v Briščikih) that lie in Italy. One of the 
aims of this dissertation was to design a tabular pattern that allows a classification of 
caves according to the state of their physical environment; risk factors for the cave; 
and their deterioration (see Methods). On one hand, the selected caves were used as a 
basis for the tabular pattern, while on the other hand their physical environment, risk 
factors, use and deterioration were described. A different selection of caves (e.g. 
more caves in Italy) would not influence the pattern, but it could have an effect on 
descriptions of cave physical environment, risk factors, cave use and deterioration. 
One should bear in mind that there are significant differences between 
Slovene and Italian cave protection legislation (see the chapter Formal Protection of 
Caves in Slovenia and in the Autonomous Region Friuli - Venezia Giulia (Furlanija – 
Julijska krajina)), and that many changes were introduced since Slovenia gained 
independence (and even before in the period of ex Yugoslavia). These factors (have) 
2 
considerably influence(ed), at least on a formal level, cave use, activities that are 
allowed in caves, and activities on the surface above them. 
The selected caves are not homogenous, which is most obvious in the group 
of show caves, where the number of visitors varies from a few hundred to half a 
million a year. This is the source of important disparities in cave management and 
differences in infrastructure that is provided for visitors. Besides, some caves are 
morphologically heterogeneous. The differences between certain parts of some caves 
seem so significant that they need to be treated separately, as individual units. 
The area of research encompasses the Classical Karst in Slovenia and Italy. 
Members of the Slovene minority in Italy live here. The act that guarantees 
protection for Slovenes in Italy (Act No. 38/2001) prescribes an equivalence for 
Italian and Slovene toponymic inscriptions, which is also provided for in municipal 
statutes. Throughout the thesis, names in both languages are used – first the Italian 
one, whereas the Slovene variant is given in parenthesis.

2 HISTORY OF RESEARCH ON CAVE IMPACTS 
First descriptions of (foreign) visitors could be regarded, at least in the 
Classical Karst, as the first mentions of influences on caves, predominantly their 
physical environment. They wrote about damaged (broken) speleothems and their 
black coloration (the lights they used produced soot), extracting and trading cave formations etc. These descriptions date back into 18th century and are treated in detail 
in Shaw (2008). 
Below you may find some examples form karst research scientific literature 
that has been published in the last 20 years. 
White (1988) mentioned cave protection under the subject of land use, land 
management problems and water resource problems. He stressed that there are many 
negative impacts on karst on one hand and great aesthetic value of karst terrains on 
the other hand. This has led to many karst protected areas. He mentioned show caves 
(commercial caves) that are adapted to tourism (stairs, illumination and guided 
tours). He also mentioned recreational caving and the underground world as the area 
of wilderness. He did not mention the treatment of caves but only the need to 
consider the non-economic value of karst underground. 
Gams (2003) gave some examples about negative impacts and damage in 
Slovenian caves: darkened speleothems in many of them due to use of torches, 
breaking speleothems in the past (but still present nowadays), problems of rising dust 
in Postojnska jama cave and of scoria in Divaška jama cave. He also mentioned 
waste from cave expeditions in the Spluga della Preta cave in Italy. 
Ford and Williams (2007) study topic of human impacts and environmental 
rehabilitation – stressing mainly problems of illumination in the past, caves vs. 
tourist caves (carrying capacity), lampenflora, scientific, cultural and recreational 
values of karst lands. 
Encyclopaedia of Caves and Karst Science (Gunn, ed., 2004) has entries 
related to the thematic of cave use and cave protection: Accidents and Rescue, 
Conservation: Protected Areas, Environmental Impacts Assessment, Exploration 
Societies, Exploring Caves, Recreational Caving, Restoration of Caves and 
Speleothem Repair, Tourist Caves, Wilderness and World Heritage Sites. 
5 
The most relevant entries from Encyclopaedia of Caves (Culver, White, ed., 
2005) are Recreational Caving, Rescues and Show Caves. 
Werker and Werker (2006) edited the publication Cave Conservation and 
Restoration. It presents papers about cave conservations, management and ethics, 
cave restoration and speleothem repair. 
Research of cave impacts is usually covered in several papers in (periodical) 
publications, mainly in the USA and Australia. Several papers on cave conservation 
have been published also in Proceedings of International Show Caves Association 
(further: ISCA). 
There are different cave classifications, mainly based on type, origin, 
processes, use, values etc. of caves. But there cannot be found any classification that 
deals with the condition of cave’s physical elements or environment. It is usually 
only in the descriptions where it is mentioned that a cave is damaged. 
Especially in show caves cave classification schemes are a vital ingredient in any 
rational cave management planning (Gillieson, 1996, 253). 
Gillieson (1996, 253 – 256) indicated criteria, given by Worsboy et al. in 1982, 
that are the basis for evaluation of the value of each particular cave. Those criteria 
include: 
- geological considerations (for example specific features that relate to 
structure, stratigraphy, palaeontology or mineralogy); 
- geomorphological considerations (including features that illustrate genetic or 
chronological relationship, or particularly fine examples of cave 
morphology); 
- hydrological considerations (presence of major underground streams or lakes, 
unusual networks involving breaches of surface divides, or key elements in 
understanding the conduit network); 
- biological considerations (relating to species richness, the presence of rare 
endangered species, unusual trophic structures or key bat maternity sites); 
- archaeological and cultural considerations (presence of deep, well stratified 
deposits, the cave's role in the evolution of regional prehistory, examples of 
historic cave use such as mining or waste management, or its spiritual 
significance to indigenous people); 
6 
- geographical considerations (of remoteness and wilderness values, proximity 
to park infrastructure such as roads and camping grounds, recreational 
opportunities and accessibility from major population centres).; 
On the basis of these criteria caves can be placed in one of several use categories. 
In the case of cave classifications there should exist also a classification of 
condition of cave’s physical environment. That would mean that each cave could be 
classified in one of several classes according to defined criteria.

3 CAVES AS BASIC ELEMENTS OF KARST 
GEOSYSTEMS 
A typical cave is a low – energy environment with essential little input of energy 
over human activity periods (Gillieson, 1996, 246). 
“A cave is an environment with little contact with the outside. For this reason, 
its equilibrium may be easily changed when additional energy is introduced. Such 
changes may occur more frequently when the whole energy budget of a cave is 
small, but in the case of show caves the energy budgets are often not very small, 
because of the generally large size of the caves. Rivers or subterranean lakes play an 
important role in keeping the natural equilibrium because they may absorb any 
further input of energy more easily than rock. There are various methods available to 
keep the additional energy input into the cave as low as possible, such as so – called 
“visitors’ capacity”, which is defined as the maximum number of visitors acceptable 
in a specific time period such that no environmental parameters are permanently 
modified” (Cigna, 2005, 496 – 497). 
Caves are usually presented as a “system with physical dynamic parameters, 
principally air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric CO2, water flow and water quality” (Ford & Williams, 2007, 501). The changes in these dynamic 
parameters can usually occur in show caves that are subjected to visitors. “Every 
visitor radiates heat, moves in his cloud of exhaust gases, vapour and sheds 
particulates such as dust and lint.” (Michie, 1970 after Ford & Williams, 2007 501). 
It would be ideal that in every cave, before developing it into a show cave, the 
dynamic parameters would be established by physical measurement and its 
ecosystems and important species would be established by biological survey. Later 
on, the upper limit of the variable with the least range should not be exceeded during 
visits. The measurements were done for example in the caves in Italy, France or in 
New Zealand. The change in fluxes of energy can be most obviously shown in the 
growth of lampenflora as deleterious effect of the lights (Ford & Williams, 2007, 501 
– 502). The fluxes of energy in caves can also affect visitors, such as radon 222Rn that releases from the decay of 234U and 238U in the enclosing rocks and mineral deposits. 
9 
222Rn is a noble gas but it decays to particulate 218Po, 214Po and 214Bi, which may 
adhere to aerosols and build up in lungs. High radon concentrations are in places 
where there is low energy with little air flow to clear accumulations (Ford & 
Williams, 2007, 501, 502). 
Heaton (1986) introduced the concept of energy levels for caves. According 
to his classification caves can be grouped in 3 main categories: high – energy, 
moderate – energy and low – energy caves. High – energy caves experience high 
energy events on a regular basis, e.g. periodic flooding; in the moderate – energy 
caves the most significant processes may be running water, wind or activities of the 
animals; in low – energy caves the normal events may be falling drops of water from 
the ceiling to the floor. “According to this classification, caves of the first class will 
not be disturbed by any tourist accommodation of flow of visitors because such caves 
will be totally rearranged by rockfall or floodwater within a year. In caves of 
moderate – energy the presence of visitors may have a more lasting effect because 
the energy released by visitors may be of the same magnitude of that released by 
natural processes that normally operate in such caves (Cigna & Forti, 1989, 31).” In a 
low – energy system the impact of human entry, no matter how carefully managed, 
may be considerable” (Watson et al., 1997, 19). “In those caves in a short time 
interval much more energy may be introduced as it has experienced in a thousand 
years (Cigna & Forti, 1989, 31)”. 
Caves can be described also through the geosystem concept. In the 
paragraphs below Sauro and Castiglioni are cited from 2009. 
”Karst and thus the caves may be considered also a large and complex karst 
geo-ecosystem in which five fundamental components are recognized: lithosphere, 
atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and anthroposphere. Each is characterized by its 
own specific elements and processes that are in a state of continuous interaction, in 
balance with both the resulting structure and the dynamics of the geo-ecosystem as a 
whole. 
It is possible to distinguish karst geo-ecosystems at different scales, such as a 
mountain group, a cave, a doline or a single karren form such as a runnel. Zooming- 
in from the general view to the detailed level allows a better comprehension of the 
10 
dynamics of the geosystem as a whole and of its constituent elements, considered as 
individual meso- or micro-systems. 
The geosystem concept is applied to a specific type of geographical unit, the 
karst morpho-unit, i.e. an area identified by its overall relief and its internal 
topography, and composed mainly of soluble rocks in which mass wasting and 
morphogenesis are mostly linked to the karst process. The resulting forms are not 
only on the surface but also underground. 
In a systemic overview a karst morpho-unit may be considered in terms of all 
its components (including lithological, structural, geomorphological, pedological, 
chemico-physical, biological and anthropological). It is then comparable to a black 
box, from which is possible to obtain information, both penetrating inside the box 
through the natural gaps and analysing the fluxes of matter and energy that are 
entering, crossing and coming out of the system. 
Water flow can be compared to a matter and energy conveyor belt that 
crosses the system. The elements of the geosystem are the physical entities (or 
groups of physical entities) that define its structure, both throughout the geosystem 
(e.g. the rock, the soil, the water, the air) and more locally (i.e. a doline, a cave, an 
artefact). It is possible to group the elements on the basis of a common characteristic 
(e.g. solid, liquid, gaseous elements; abiological, biological elements; fixed and 
mobile elements; natural and anthropogenic elements, etc.). The main elements 
constituting the “structure” of the geosystem pertain to the different states of matter, 
solid, liquid and gas, such as the rock and the water, in its solid, liquid and gas 
phases. Also, the portion of the atmosphere that is in contact with the liquid and solid 
interfaces and penetrating inside caves is part of the geosystem. 
The modelling of a geosystem must be preceded by a schedule of analyses 
examining variables closely and following-up any new lines of investigation. Each of 
these analyses will be devoted mainly to a single aspect of the overall character of 
the geosystem. In particular the karst system will be considered as: a complex of 
elements (structure), a focus of processes, an amalgamation of fluxes and an entity 
that is evolving continuously. 
Many elements that characterize most karst geosystems are directly or 
indirectly linked with human presence and activities; e.g. the parcels and enclosures 
related to different ways of using the soil, the settlements, systems to carry, collect 
11 
and store water, structures to accommodate or entertain tourists, signs of abandoned 
agricultural practices, etc. 
Interfaces, i.e. the contacts and separation surfaces between lithosphere, 
hydrosphere and atmosphere, or, in general, between the solid, liquid and gas 
components of the system, are important as the places where most processes take 
place. It is possible to distinguish the following interfaces: the rock/air interface; the 
rock/water interface; the water/air interface. These are the main zones of interaction 
between lithosphere and atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere, and hydrosphere 
and atmosphere. The dynamics and the processes of the geosystem act mainly 
between one or more components across interfaces. Inside karst geosystem in 
limestone, the most important process, which occurs at the rock/air and rock/water 
interfaces, is the chemical dissolution of the rock by the natural solution acidified by 
carbon dioxide that is present in the air and in the soil. This process is characterized 
by exchange phenomena between different states of matter and determines a mass 
transfer, from the solid state to the liquid state, of calcium carbonate, which is 
dissolved following its separation into ions. A portion of the dissolved limestone will 
precipitate as limestone tufa or cave speleothems and in this way will remain inside 
the geosystem, whereas another portion is definitively lost with the runoff water. 
Many elements within the geosystem are the result of a series of formational 
and/or transformational events, which define the “history” of the same elements. 
Such histories can be considered as cycles or fluxes, or may be connected with cyclic 
events or with the great fluxes that are expressions of the dynamics of the Earth. In 
the karst geosystem, for example, limestone is the result of a long history that began 
with fixation by the biosphere of carbon dioxide gas, which was present as a large 
proportion of the primitive atmosphere. The soluble rock, which now constitutes the 
passive component of a geosystem, is the result of a flux of matter between the 
atmosphere and the lithosphere that has progressed cyclically through the activity of 
the biosphere across geological time. 
In the geosystem, the most easily perceived flux is that of water. In a karst 
geosystem the water flux takes on particular characteristics according to the presence 
of well developed but hidden “underground” parts of the same system. The analysis 
of such flux is fundamental to understand the dynamics of the entire system because 
the water can be compared to a “measuring tape” related to different environmental 
variables. Analysis of the cycles and fluxes of energy and matter confirms the 
12 
flexible nature of the karst geosystem, which is evolving continuously. Exchanges of 
matter and energy take place both inside the system, in association with the 
interfaces, and at the contact with adjacent geosystems. 
The evolution of a geosystem may be considered in terms of different time 
scales and at different resolutions, as for example in the evolution of a rill or of a 
doline. It is also possible to attempt to reconstruct the geological and 
geomorphological history of a large karst morpho-unit that extended across a time 
span of several million years. 
The geological history of a complex karst geosystem can be schematized in terms of 
the following main phases: 
- pre-orogenic phase: deposition and diagenesis of the rocks that constitute the 
framework of the present-day geosystem; 
- orogenic phase: uplift and tectonic imprinting of the relief; 
- morphogenetic phase: evolution of the landforms; 
- pedogenetic and recent climatic phase: development of the biological 
environments during the latest climatic period (Holocene); 
- anthropogenic phase: changes of the natural forms and equilibrium by human 
activities and introduction into the landscape of new elements that were not 
present previously. 
The different phases are not sharply defined, but more or less overlap 
in time and space. 
During the last decades especially, changes have occurred more and more 
quickly in response to modifications of the traditional forms of land use (agriculture, 
grazing, breeding and forestry) and the introduction of new forms (in particular 
tourism), which have led to a reduction of the human presence in some areas and an 
increase in others. 
It is important to study and to monitor the environment, in particular in the karst 
geosystems, which are particularly fragile and vulnerable, in an attempt to reduce the 
impacts through the application of a sustainable management plan. The modelling 
and checking of the agreement between the models, by monitoring and performing 
experiments (such as water tracing with special dyes), can provide fundamental 
information to help plan interventions to mitigate the human impact. The models also 
13 
provide important indications of the stability or instability (the equilibrium) of a 
geosystem and, consequently, about its vulnerability. Models based on 
environmental data and tested through planned experiments provide a fundamental 
framework for understanding the characteristics of a geosystem and for planning its 
proper management and sustainable development.”

4 OBJECTIVES AND AIMS 
The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the impacts from the surface in the 
research area on the basis of the degree of cave conservation or the damage done on 
cave inventory. 
The aims are: 
1) To evaluate the significance of cave physical environment in each of the 
selected caves. 
2) To evaluate the use (past and present) of each selected cave. 
3) To list and evaluate impacts to cave physical environment. 
4) To make a pattern that will enable a classification of conservation. The 
pattern is made on a special inventory sheet into which one enters numerical 
data about the characteristics of cave physical environment, hazards to it (due 
to energy flow, type of access, cave use, type of visitors and influences on the 
cave from the surface) and damage in the cave. 
5) To give the recommendations for further minimal impacts on cave physical 
environment and proposals for necessary interventions. 
6) To determine the turning points when certain types of behaviour in caves 
started being perceived as harmful. 
7) To present good and bad practices in cave management. 
8) To give the general overview of conditions of physical environment in caves. 
More visits of caves cause greater pressures on caves and their environment. 
Each cave that is discovered, explored and visited is subjected to negative impacts. 
Caves have diverse degrees of vulnerability, risk and hazard – deriving from 
different burden and physical characteristics of caves and show caves are more 
exposed to negative impacts than other caves. The greatest damage is done on 
flowstone and the negative impacts of physical environment are greater in caves that 
have greater frequency of visits – caves with easier access and well – known caves. 
With the intention of protecting vulnerable cave environment and developing 
activities (for example recreational caving, scientific research or tourist 
16 
development) it is necessary to adapt cave visits and cave use in such way that the 
damage is as little as possible. 
The evaluation of impacts of visitors is done in the caves of Classical Karst in the 
temperate zone and thus it would be interesting to compare the impacts, according to 
cave use and physical characteristics, also in other karst zones, as the climate and 
water conditions might influence the impacts. 
5 METHODS 
The selection of the method and problems encountered 
The selection of the method was rather difficult. The main problem was to 
define the “original value” or a “primary value” in the cave, meaning the conditions 
of physical environment before deterioration. There are some exceptions where data 
about deterioration is available. In several caves it is also difficult to define if for 
example the speleothems were broken by people or by natural processes. 
In some cases, the value of a certain category of negative influences is high 
and has a significant influence on cave physical environment; nevertheless, the 
influence is slightly diminished when compared with the sum of all influences. This 
could be illustrated by a cave with mostly damaged flowstone formations and no 
other forms of deterioration. 
Another problem is the aesthetic value of the caves; in some caves the 
deterioration is statistically, scientifically, etc. not so important, but their aesthetic 
value can be reduced. And vice versa: most of the visitors take care of the flowstone 
formations and forget (or are not aware) about importance of the fine sediments and 
cause great damage with footprints. 
Caves have different degrees of vulnerability. But it seem that we “see” that 
caves which have been explored only recently are more vulnerable than the same 
types of caves that have been explored in the past and are already damaged. This 
derives from the fact that in a non – damaged cave, recently explored, every trace is 
very visible, such as footprint, soiled formation, etc., while in a cave which is already 
damaged, those (even minor) traces are far not so visible and thus – in the mind of 
visitors – less important. 
17 
The caves are very complex systems, composed of different states of matter 
(solid, liquid, and gas) and the solid components are of many different types – 
primary limestone, chemical deposits – flowstone formations, bedrock, clastic 
deposits, etc. Beside this, the interfaces between the different elements, composing 
caves, are very complex and with a very large surface extension – if compared with 
simple parameters of the topographical relief. It is also important whether a cave is 
well or poorly explored. Besides the explored parts, there are also unknown 
(unexplored) parts of a cave that may even be larger (longer or deeper) than the 
explored ones. 
Even though the caves are divided in several groups regarding their 
morphology, many of them are morphologically variegated and each sector of the 
cave should be discussed separately, as well as the deterioration and the impacts in 
these sectors. 
The use of a quantitative method to define the impacts of visitors in the caves 
would be perfect. But due to above mentioned problems the use of a complete 
quantitative method for all types of human impacts would be almost impossible. 
For these reasons it is nearly impossible to produce an exact model of a cave 
system both from the point of view of its structure and, in particular, from the point 
of view of its physical characteristics and exchanges of energy. In any case, in order 
to make a model of a cave, it is necessary to get a large amount of environmental 
data thorough the monitoring with appropriate sensors and data loggers of the main 
physical and chemical parameters. To get detailed data about damage in a cave it 
would be also necessary to monitor the damage, for example the measurements of 
the damage on flowstone gours according to the frequency of visitors. 
For these reasons, in this thesis a semi – quantitative (descriptive) method 
was used, based on field observations and collection of semi – quantitative data. 
The method used 
First, we classified the selected caves (case studies) into four groups: 
- show (tourist/managed) caves (7 caves); 
- well known caves (9 caves); 
- less known caves (4 caves); 
18 
- easily accessible caves (4 caves). 
Each cave is presented in the dissertation as follows: 
- The general speleological description of the cave with the survey; the survey 
is usually author work and expresses also kind of art. Thus, the surveys in the 
thesis are scanned copies of original surveys and are of different scales. Only 
those where the originals have been damaged or are so old and badly visible, 
have been drawn again. 
- History of the cave and cave use. 
- Impacts to the cave physical environment. 
The number of visitors is easily defined only in show caves and in caves with a 
controlled access. In all other caves the number and type of visitors can only be 
estimated. For each selected cave the number of visitors was estimated according to 
the information on visit from cavers. 
We selected different sets of variables or parameters: 
- Evaluation of cave’s physical environment 
Evaluation of cave’s physical environment summarizes the importance cave physical 
environment and particularity of the cave. 
There have not been any great difficulties in defining the criteria, although the 
criteria are likely to be semi – quantitative; 
- Hazard to cave’s physical environment 
There are different kinds of hazards to cave’s physical environment, deriving 
from characteristics of the cave (and thus the possibility of the flow of matter and 
energy) and from cave use. 
Caves with greater dimensions of entrances and/or passages are less vulnerable 
due to greater flow of energy and matter. 
In several cases, the caves with intense and long cave use are more exposed to 
deterioration and thus more vulnerable. An important data is also the presence of 
different type of visitors in the cave and the intensity of their activities in the cave. 
- Influences on the cave from the surface 
There have been chosen the most important impacts and activities on the surface that 
may have important negative impacts to caves. 
19 
- Deterioration 
This parameter summarizes the present condition in the caves. Classification of 
these parameters was the most difficult part, as already described. The main aim was 
to evaluate the deterioration of the most significant components of the cave. 
As mentioned above, it is important to note that there are also examples where 
one category of elements of human impacts has assumed importance for the cave 
history or environment but the final sum does not show the importance of it. 
To facilitate comparisons and get a systematic review, we draw up a table 
(Table 4.1) where a numerical value (points) could be set for every parameter; 
usually these were 1, 3 or 5 (Tables 4.2 and 4.3). There are slight differences 
between evaluation parameters for tourist and other caves. 
Numerical values are inevitably subjective; they are based on the difference 
between “least”, “medium” and “most”. Value 1 signifies “least” (for example: no 
cave sediments in the cave, the largest flow of energy – which means that the cave is 
less vulnerable to visitors; that its use is (was) extensive; that visits are controlled; 
that it is situated in a remote area; that influences from visitors and deterioration are 
minimal, as well as the pollution of the cave from the surface); value 3 signifies 
“medium”, while value 5 means “most” (for example: the presence of cave sediments 
that are of particular shapes and forms; energy flow through the cave – relative to the 
dimensions of cave channels – is low; the cave is easily accessible and has been 
known for a long time; the impacts of visitors, risks for pollution from the surface 
and deterioration are very significant). 
Lower values indicate that cave inventory (physical environment) is not present 
or its elements are less vulnerable, and such caves are less prone to energy flow 
influences. They are less visited and their use is less intensive; also the impacts of 
visitors, deterioration and risk from the surface are limited. 
We used numerical values to determine the significance of a cave on the basis of 
its physical environment, risks to the environment (as regards energy flow, access to 
the cave, the use of the cave, type of visitors and risk factors on the surface above the 
cave), and deterioration in the cave.

Classification 
After we had set a numerical value for all parameters we got a certain number 
of points for every group (e.g.: max 20 points for the group Evaluation of cave’s 
physical environment, max 50 points for the group Deterioration etc.). Then we 
established the number of classes with the Sturges formula ( 10 1 3.322log K N = + ), 
where K is the number of classes and N is the number of data. 
Individual groups contained the following data sets: 
- Evaluation of the cave's physical environment: 4 
- Hazard to cave's physical environment 
o Energy flow: 3 
o Type of access: 3 
o Cave use – caves: 5; show caves: 2 
o Type of visitors – caves: 3, show caves: 5 
o Influences on the cave from the surface-past, present and potential: 7 
- Deterioration: caves: 10, show caves: 11 
This process was used to establish classes; we categorised the caves into individual 
classes according to the total number of points awarded on the basis of individual 
parameters. 
According to the data and Sturges formula the groups Type of visitors, 
Influences on the cave from the surface and Deterioration would be of 4 classes. In 
order to have better comparison three classes were used for all parameters, only the 
parameters for Cave use were classified in two classes. 
It is important to use the text description and the tables to get the optimal 
impression about each cave. 
The most representative characteristics of individual classes were stated 
(Table 4.4, 4.5).

6 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF KARST CAVES TODAY 
AND MILESTONES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF 
NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN CAVES 
The first question that might appear when we discuss visitors in caves and their 
impact might be: why are we so sensitive to the damage in caves? 
The answers might be: 
- The awareness of importance of caves and their role. Caves are closely 
connected with underground water flow and so with water sources. The 
importance of clean, potable water is increasing at the same time as the 
pressures on environment are increasing. 
- One would of course prefer to visit an undamaged cave to a cave where 
speleothems are broken and soiled, where carbide dumps and waste material 
are scattered around and footprints can be seen all over the cave. For most of 
the cavers and visitors the aesthetic value of a cave is mainly in the flowstone 
formations. 
- Caves can be visited only by a limited number of people. There is a great 
difference between caves and surface geomorphological sites. Accessible 
caves are not as abundant as surface natural phenomena and they are also 
accessible to a limited group of people. So it is to be expected that we pay 
more attention because we have the privilege to visit a small piece of 
underground. In the last two centuries there have been continual explorations 
of all kinds of landscapes. There are only few types of landscapes that still 
offer new discoveries, and one of them are the caves. 
- Scientific point of view. Caves are an important indicator about the evolution 
of a certain area. Damaged caves may have lost some important information 
about the past environmental history and human frequentation. 
- The permanence. Relatively closed environment with no great changes in 
climate and hydrological conditions mean that the impacts remain at the place 
where they were caused. The damage left in caves (for example waste and 
carbide dumps) cannot decay as fast as on the surface. Another example is 
footprints: on the surface they are washed away with the first rain, but in 
32 
caves they can remain always if they are on dry places with small quantities 
of percolating water. 
One of the main reasons for man’s concern for caves is the awareness that time in 
a cave passes more slowly. In the case of cavers, this concern is even greater because 
they understand and really appreciate the achievements of the first explorers. 
Another important aspect is also the change through time. Through the centuries 
and years the ethics have changed. As today it is a general rule that there should be 
no carbide dumps in caves or that breaking speleothems is absolutely intolerable, it 
always has not been so. A shift in the perceptions of graffiti has been noticed. It is 
only in the last 10 to 15 years that graffiti or putting the names of visitors in caves is 
regarded as damage. 
The damage that is done in caves by their visitors is accumulating as we know 
that the cave’s regeneration capacities are very small and cave resources are non- 
renewable. The damage or complete destruction of cave content leads to the loss of 
the scientific value of the cave as well as the loss of aesthetic attractiveness for its 
visitors. But above all it leads to the loss of natural heritage. 
Caves are mysterious, not only from the point of view – what is in their 
depths – but also for those who explore them. Most probably there are no caves that 
are explored to the end and in all their passages. Thus caves are kind of a black box. 
If we do not explore something in the cave – a passage or a particular formation – we 
cannot say that it does not exist in that cave. And even if we do explore it we need 
detailed analysis to find out some particular facts. An example are fine sediments or 
other particular formations; until we do not find them they have minor importance; 
but when we find them and analyse them (and get important data and information) 
they become even more important. Going further on, every cave is particular and 
significant – even if it has been already damaged. Usually the damaged caves loose 
their aesthetic and scientific value but there might be that some important records 
remain; in this case it is important that we prevent the cave from further devastation. 
Due to these facts, the caves are very vulnerable to the presence of humans and to the 
activities in and above them. 
The importance of caves on the research area, their use and treatment of caves 
has changed considerably in the last two centuries. In the beginning of cave exploration in the late 19th century the main aim of cave exploration was to explore 
33 
caves for water sources for Trieste and later setting the routes for visitors. In the 
years when the Kras was part of Italy and the Mussolini regime expanded, visiting 
caves became a sport activity as all societies had to become dopolavoro societies. 
After World War II caving has become a multiple activity. The most important aim 
of caving is cave exploration, on the Kras the exploration of the underground Reka, 
not for water sources, but to know the underground water flow and to contribute to 
science. Caving is also a sport activity: some visitors find in caving an adventurous 
joy; visitors to caves can be specialized in several branches, not necessarily of cave 
exploration itself, but can be interested in archaeology, remains of wars, biology, etc. 
There appears an interesting question: What are the grounds that shaped our 
system of values and our concern for caves? It seems that in our region most probably it derives from the 18th century when foreign visitors were admiring the 
beauty of caves on the Kras. Thus, the system of worth derives from the early development of cave tourism in the 17th century when Vilenica became a show cave. 
At the same time as the (foreign) visitors were visiting the caves on the Kras and 
with the development of tourism, great damage began to be done in caves. Those 
visitors of course described the damage they have seen. Shaw (2008) for example 
describes several foreign travellers in the Slovenian Classical Karst in the period 
1486 – 1900 and also mentions the visit of Baron Josef von Hammer – Purgstall in 
1798. He visited Vilenica and described the cave and the guide. It is quoted from 
Hammer – Purgstall note also that at the end of the visit the guide “hammered off a 
dozen sizable pieces of this time, too, with which he hoped to make a great 
impression upon Englishmen passing through” (Shaw, 2008, 90 – 91). The foreign 
visitors were describing precisely the damage that is done and the infrastructure in 
the cave. 
Breaking of speleothems in caves must be as old as humankind has been using 
caves. But it became more intensive with the development of tourism. The trend of 
breaking the speleothems, giving them as souvenirs and their sale expanded later on. 
As mentioned by Simić (2000) the first initiatives for cave protection, mainly 
because of very expanding vandalism and robbery of speleothems for sale, began 
before World War I. He mentioned several notes from different papers. Habe in 1968 
noted that the governor of the country prohibited the use of resin torches and damage 
34 
to the speleothems in Postojnska jama in 1825 but did not prevent the sale in front of 
the cave of the speleothems that were taken in other caves (Simić, 2000, 50, 51). 
In the next periods there were several other initiatives, within the initiatives for 
cave protection to stop and prohibit breaking and selling of the speleothems. But the 
processes continued, especially during World Wars and even afterwards. There are 
several local people and cavers who mention the orders of men of note, mainly 
political, to bring the speleothems from caves. It is not to be expected that this kind 
of vandalism will ever stop as there are always exceptions. But in general it seems 
that since 1990s the speleothems are not cut in caves any more or taken out of caves 
for purposes such as sale and souvenirs. 
One of the important sources of damage in caves is that they have been used as 
waste dumps. It is not known since when this occurred, but there was a note in 1913 
in the newspaper Laibacher Zeitung that in the karst area the shafts and caves are 
used for the deposition of all kind of waste and cadavers (Simić, 2000, 54). This use 
was long established. The structure of waste in caves on the Kras shows that the 
caves were used as waste dumps by locals, industry and army. The most expanded 
deposition of waste began after World War II with the general development of 
industry and living standard. The process of depositing waste in caves considerably 
reduced after the introduction of carrying off the waste from houses in the 1990s, 
after the new regulations in industry and the decline of some branches of industry, 
and after the removal of the army. 
The traces of cavers date back to the end of World War I in the time of the Italian 
dopolavoro. The signatures of the visitors and cavers before World War I were 
mainly made with graphite pencils and were small. After World War I the great 
graffiti, made with colour appear, describing the date of visit, names of visitors and 
their society. This practice also lasted in caves after World War II and it is only since 
the 1990s that the signatures are not so frequent, but they still have an important 
impact in caves. 
One of the most visible impacts, which are difficult to lessen, is footprints 
appearing in the majority of the caves. The footprints are as old as cave explorations 
and they will keep appearing in all caves until the practice of equipping them with 
trail markers at the very beginning of explorations becomes a standard. 
One of the most obvious impacts of cavers is carbide dumps in caves. It is 
difficult to set the date since when the cavers were leaving the used carbide in caves. 
35 
New carbide dumps have hardly appeared in the last ten years. The reason is in the 
raising awareness of cavers and in the fact that in the last ten years electric lights are 
more usual. 
In the last 20 years cavers are more and more equipping the caves with trail 
markers and this importantly contributes to the protection of cave floors and reduces 
the off – trail footprints and soiled formations. 
7 CAVE USE 
Mankind has been using and has been connected with caves from old times. 
There are many uses of caves with different purposes in different regions of the 
world. Here are the most important cave uses on a few examples from Slovenian and 
Italian karst regions. 
“The overall human relationship to caves probably comprises three major 
phases. The first is marked by extensive use of caves for shelter, habitation, and 
ritual purposes. Caves were not feared or avoided, but often appear to have provided 
desirable residential locations. The transition to the next phase seems to mark a 
significant step in cultural evolution. Although some cave sites continued to be 
utilized in various ways, many were abandoned, and there seems to have been a 
flowering of legends which portrayed caves as places to be feared, often because 
they were reputed to be the abode of various imagined monsters or evil spirits. 
Progressively, at different times in different cultures, this curiosity was translated 
into the final phase of travel and investigation, at the beginnings of the natural 
sciences. The great rise in investigatory and other more or less individualized travel came with the 15th and 16th centuries, particularly in Europe. Many travellers have 
since visited and described caves” (Hamilton–Smith, 2004a, 725). 
7.1 Caves as shelters, hiding and living places 
One of the oldest uses of caves is as places of residence or shelter from bad 
weather. In Palaeolithic people were living mainly in karst caves. In cold periods of 
Pleistocene, caves were used as shelters and living places due to favourable 
temperatures. The most suitable caves were those with entrances situated on sunny 
slopes. An important need of life is water. As the karst area has no autochthonous 
36 
water sources, the population density was not high. Most of the Palaeolithic stations 
are situated close to the water sources. There are several horizontal caves in the 
Pivka region where the archaeological sites were very dense and settlement 
continued to the Neolithic. The most well known is Betalov spodmol cave, situated 
between the villages Zagon and Otok, in the vicinity of Postojnska jama. Important 
caves from the Palaeolithic are also in the regions Štajerska, Dolenjska, Gorenjska 
and in Kamniško– Savinjske Alpe (Gams, 2003, 92 – 94). 
Important archaeological finds from Pleistocene on the Kras were in caves 
Ludvikova jama and Jama v Partu pri Ogradi. Cavers of Jamarsko društvo Seţana 
found bones of Pleistocene wolverine (Gulo gulo) in Ludvikova jama and many 
antlers in Jama v Partu pri Ogradi. There on one piece of antler a 1.5 m high 
stalagmite has formed (Cerkvenik et al.., 2008, 84). One of the most important 
Neolithic caves is Bestaţovca near Seţana where at a depth of 43 m several 
archaeological finds were found over a length of 40 m. There were found bones of 
humans and animals, 22 fragments of ceramics and some other pieces (Turk & 
Saksida, 1988, 200). An important archaeological site from Neolithic is also Vilenica 
where cavers found pieces of ceramics (Cerkvenik et al., 2008, 84). 
More recently, caves have also served as shelters, temporary or permanent 
places of residence of pagans, heretics or outlaws. Perhaps the most well known are 
caves used by gipsies, hermits, and refugees (Gams, 1982, 37). In Slovenia some 
caves were occupied until the beginning of World War I (Gams, 2003, 95). In the 
highlands the caves have served as shelters in the bad weather conditions for sheep, 
herdsmen, hunters, foresters and woodmen (Gams, 1982, 39). 
Several caves in karst areas were used as shelters or hiding places against enemies in different periods of time. In the 15th century locals were hiding against 
the Turks. In front of several caves walls were built for protection (Gams, 2003, 
100). Among several examples is the best well known Predjama cave with the 
Erasmus castle in the mouth of the cave (Gams, 1982, 37). 
Karst caves were also of great importance in both World Wars. The use of 
caves in World Wars belongs to the use as shelters or hiding places on one hand and 
on the use as storehouses, water supply and deposing of bodies on the other hand. 
Caves have also been used as medical facilities for treatment (Day & Kueny, 2004, 
509 – 511). Wider shafts and caves were used as hiding places in the hinterland of 
the Soča front (Isonzo Front) during World War I in the mountain ranges of Kanin, 
37 
Krn, Rombon, and karst plateaus of Doberdò (Doberdob) and Kostanjevica (Gams, 
2003, 100). In 1916 a cave building detachment of the VII Corpus was established on 
the Kras. There were 500 men in it and it was led by speleologist, engineer first 
lieutenant Alois Peter Bock. The Corpus explored and reshaped several caves. At the 
end of May, 1917 there were 2.059 beds in caves. Additionally there were enough places for 1.156 soldiers in shelters. Altogether there was available 17.300 m2 
covered area in caves and caverns on the Kras (Simić, 1996, 140). One of the best 
known caves that were used in World War I was Grofova jama or Vogenca cave 
(Cerkvenik et al., 2008, 50).

7.2 Caves in cult use or mythology manner 
Caves (and other karst features) have acquired profound spiritual significance 
in many parts of the world. Some karstic religious sites bear physical testimony to 
adoption by successive traditions, while some remain shared between faiths. The 
religious significance of caves and karst varies across and within traditions. 
Christianity is arguably the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen, and 
rejects animism and pantheism in favour of a monotheistic outlook. Extensive 
physical modification of the entrances to sacred caves is common (Kiernan, 2004, 
38 
622, 624). The cult or mythological use of caves is as places of sacrifice, for 
preservation of skeletons, temples, belief, and worship of God or even cemeteries 
(Gams, 2003). 
Many people around the world believe in the origin of the life from the caves. 
In the middle Ages, caves were also believed to be places where the devil was born 
and thus many names of caves contain the name of devil. Together with the devil 
there was also the origin of natural phenomena, such as storms, clouds and rain 
(Gams, 2003, 103 – 105). It is known that stories about caves very often have 
worldwide, European or regional spread, and are rarely local. It is only the scene that 
changes; for example there are several places where the oxen had fallen into the 
shafts and springs where the yoke had come out (Gams, 1982, 36). 
Caves as cult objects are still in use in some parts of the world. In our region 
there are some caves in which the worship of God turned from pre–Christian to 
Christian religion. Such caves were Sveta jama pri Socerbu and Grotta di San 
Giovanni d’Antro (Landarska jama) (Italy) where the rituals have remained until 
today. According to Valvasor there used to be more caves that served for rituals 
(Gams, 1982, 35). There were 98 wooden stairs, later made in cement. In the cave 
there is the altar of John the Baptist, who was worship already in the time when he 
was visiting the caves and caverns. The cave had been used as shelter against the 
barbarian invasion. In Sveta jama St. Servij, martyr from Trieste, had lived in the cave in the 3rd century. In the cave the altar had been cut partly in the flowstone but was destroyed in the 20th century. Examples of worshipping of the cult of Mithra can 
be found in a pagan temple in a shape of a notch above the railway track at the 
village of Roţanec in Bela Krajina (Gams, 2003, 97–99), and near Duino (Devin) in 
Italy.

There is not much known about caves as burial places or worship of cave 
features and speleothems as used in some regions in Asia. There the cult of 
masculinity and penis and the hollow cult of fertility (femininity) are still known. But 
there have been some cave names in Slovenia that might originate from such a cult 
(Gams, 1982, 35). 
Among many archaeological caves on the Kras Mušja jama cave near 
Škocjan is one of the most important ones. More than 240 items (mainly different 
kinds of weapon) was found in a 50 m deep shaft. The finds date in the time between 12th and 8th century BC and they are remains of sacrifice. Their origin is the Panonian 
and Mediterranean region (Turk, 2002). 
The cave culture usually includes cave paintings, engravings or statuettes. 
The most frequently sculptured features were animals (Gams, 2003, 96). The vast 
majority of prehistoric rock art occurs in the open air or in shallow rock shelters, but 
an important body of art is also placed in the total darkness within deep caves in a 
few parts of the world (Bahn, 2004, 84). 
The cultural importance of karst and caves was studied recently by Travassos 
in his doctoral thesis (Travassos, 2011).

7.3 Caves as places of deposition 
Throughout human history, caves have always been used as places of 
deposition of different materials, either on purpose or accidentally. Within this cave 
use the best known is the use for storehouses and waste dumps. 
The oldest use of caves as places of deposition is for drinks, meat, and 
chopped wood. Perhaps better known is the use of potable water from caves (for 
example Vilenica, Dolnja Vodena jama at Višnje in Suha krajina, Zijalka at Petkove 
njive on Korošica, etc.) in the lowland, as well as in highlands for herdsmen (Gams, 
1982, 39). During World Wars several caves served as shelters or storehouses for 
material and ammunition and for blasting for military purposes. Over 100 Slovenian 
caves were modified for military use during World War I. In many caves the material 
remained in, some also unexploded. Caves served also as a place to get rid of people 
who were enemies or were against the political regime (Day & Kueny, 2004, 509, 
510). 
Figure 7.3: Ammunition dump, cave near Seţana. Photo by: Emil Kariţ 
One of examples of very well known illegal deposition of unexploded means 
of waging war is in Polhova jama cave, 3 km north from Pivka. The material was 
41 
placed in the cave by the Yugoslav army in the period 1952 – 1959. The cave is 114 
m long and 50 m deep with an entrance shaft of 42 m deep. In the cave there was a 
deposit of great amounts of unexploded material, mainly different kinds of mines and 
grenades, lighters and detonators. On the bottom of the entrance shaft there was a 
deposition 15 m long, 7 m wide and 3.5 m high. The deposition was covered with a 
thick cover of organic waste from a poultry farm. The material that was deposited in 
the cave was mainly what was not suitable for further use. According to some locals 
such deposits are also in some other caves in the vicinity. That cave was cleaned of 
the organic waste and 27.164,4 kg of unexploded ammunition in 1985 (Ušeničnik, 
2002, 138 – 148). 
There have been also some caves, used for storing explosives for industry. In 
present Puševca cave near Seţana was rebuilt and serves as storehouses for 
explosives for the building industry. 
It is very common for caves to be used as waste dumps, for sewage water and 
for deposing dead animals. There is no data of the number of caves filled with waste, 
but for sure the numbers in the cave registry are much lower than in reality. Almost 
every village has had its own waste shaft. In the Kras in Slovenia (municipalities of 
Seţana, Divača, Hrpelje – Kozina and Komen) there are more than 1.100 caves on the territory of 660 km2. According to the data from the cave registry there are only 8 
polluted caves. It is estimated that more than 100 caves are polluted in the 
municipalities of Seţana and Komen (Jamarsko društvo Seţana, 2009). The nature of 
waste material shows that both households and industry used caves as waste dumps. 
Most is domestic, solid, building, industrial and military waste material. 
Caves can also be used as sinks for wastewater and sewage from water 
treatment plants. At present there are three caves known on the Kras where 
wastewater flows into the cave. 
Kačna jama extends under Divača. In 1997 and 1998 new passages were 
explored. In a certain part of the cave a minor jet of water flows from the ceiling. 
Most probably it is connected with the sewage water from the doline Krgunce on the 
surface of the cave where the treatment plant is located. Two cavers got almost 
poisoned with the gases as a passage is highly polluted with the waste water. This 
part of the cave is called Divaška sramota (Divača shame). Above it there is the shaft 
42 
called Brezno dobre vode (The shaft of good water), that got its name after the water 
jet, flowing from the ceiling. As the cavers were very thirsty and the water seemed 
clean they were drinking it. One of them got poisoned by it. The pollution was also 
proved with analysis made by Inštitut za raziskovanje krasa ZRC SAZU (further: 
IZRK) from Postojna (Nagode, 1998, 133). 
Jama v Bjekovniku cave, located near Seţana is declared a natural monument. 
The water from nearby water treatment plan flows directly into the cave. Not far 
away from the cave there is Jama 1 v Kanjaducah cave where the underground 
course of Reka is reached and extends under the passages of Jama v Bjekovniku. 
Links can be made between the water from water treatment plant and the permanent 
waterfall in Jama 1 v Kanjaducah. There is a permanent, approximately 10 m high, 
waterfall with a strong smell. The analysis made in 2004 from the waterfall show 
strong pollution with organic substances (Mihevc, Rijavec, 2006). Cave explorations 
in Jama 1 v Kanjaducah in summer 2009 showed a strong flow of the waterfall, 
despite dry weather conditions. The colour of the river also changed considerably 
after the confluence with the water from the waterfall. Cave divers also reported a 
strong smell in the sump part of the cave and the bad visibility – less than 20 cm. 
One of the sources of pollution of the Kras underground is also Reka river 
that was highly polluted in the period from 1955 until 1990 with a peak in the early 
1980s. The main source of pollution was industry. The wood factory and the factory 
of organic acid contributed 95% of all pollution and 80 – 88% of waste water from 
Ilirska Bistrica (Mejač et al., 1983, 48 – 51). In 1982 daily pollution due to industry 
in Ilirska Bistrica was diminished by one third but it was still too high to allow self– 
purification processes. In autumn 1990 the factory of organic acids was closed. In 
January 1992 a considerable improvement of Reka quality at its sinking in Škocjanske jame was recorded. The overall water quality improved from the 4th quality class to 2nd – 3rd quality class (Kranjc et al., 1997, 66 – 75). 
Another use of caves as place of deposition has been also as mass grave- 
yards, mainly of people who were in opposite the political and military regime. 
According to the data from cave registry of JZS human remains were found in 71 
caves in Slovenia. The exact numbers are not known as there are no official sources 
or data, but there is estimation that the number is more than 10.000 people. Most of 
the people or bodies were thrown in caves in the period 1941 – 1945 but there are 
also evidences that also soldiers from World War I were thrown in caves. For this 
43 
purpose the shafts were usually used. The bodies were in several cases covered with 
recent accumulations of various materials over the bones (waste material or 
allochtonous gravel) and in some cases there have been traces of blasting at the 
entrance. This use of caves also effects the physical environment of caves as in some examples some 10 m3 waste material was thrown over bodies or entrances were 
blasted. Caves which were used as mass graveyard are usually less known and 
located in remote woodlands (Mihevc, 1995a, 384).

7.4 Exploitation of natural resources in caves 
Mankind has been using different natural resources from caves. The most 
known are different minerals, water, ice and speleothems. 
In some countries the speleothems and moonmilk were claimed as 
medicament. The moonmilk has been believed to be good for healing eyes and 
animals. Commercial materials were different minerals and ore that were extracted 
from caves (Gams, 2003, 101 – 103). Not much is known about the use of cave 
sediments, mainly speleothems, as medicine. There are some Slovenian tales where 
the caves sediments served as medicine. Extracting ore from caves has not been wide spread in Slovenia (Gams, 1982, 37). However, already in the 17th century, Valvasor 
described the use of water in Sveta jama (Kranjc, 1992, 41). 
On the Classical Karst there has been very important and well known use of 
potable water and ice (Gams, 2003, 101 – 103). 
In the old times water was used from rivers or from gours in caves (Gams, 2003). One of the examples is Vilenica where broken pieces of pottery from 16th 
century and later periods prove that locals were using water from the pool 200 m 
inside of the cave (Puc, 2000, 18). 
Karst areas are supplied by karst water, mainly from karst springs. The most 
abundant karst springs that are used for the present water network are Malni near 
Planina, Bistrica in Ilirska Bistrica, Hubelj near Ajdovščina, etc. (Ravbar, 2005). The 
Kras region is supplied with karst water from pumping wells that are located close to 
the village Brestovica pri Komnu from Drča jama cave (Kraški vodovod, 1998). The 
Province of Trieste is supplied from Sardos (Sardoč) spring and, in case if Sardos 
(Sardoč) is not available, also from Timavo (Timava) springs (Grupo AceasAsp, 
2011). 
Ice had a great importance in the Primorska region. In the period when the 
port of Trieste was developing, the ice production began. Ice was extracted mainly 
from artificially made pools – water holes, but also from natural caves (Mihevc, 
2011a). It was kept in ice stores and most of the ice stores were dug into the ground. 
There were also some natural caves, usually abris that were partly closed with a wall, 
stopping the inflow of warm air from the outside into the interior where ice was kept 
(Belingar, 1995, 435). Ice from natural caves was transported from the high karst 
plateaus of Trnovski gozd and Nanos. One of the natural caves, from which ice was 
45 
extracted, was Ledenica v Paradani. At the bottom of the cave 10 – 40 kg pieces of 
ice were cut. They were transported out of the cave in boxes and further on to 
Gorizia or Trieste where ice was sold to ships. Ice from the cave was extracted until 
1953. In the period 1920 – 1926 it was also used for the brewery in Senoţeče (Gams, 
2003, 101 – 103). 
Exploitation of speleothems is also known. Shaw (2010) gives several 
examples of exploitation of speleothems. Some of them are cited below. In Slovenia 
the greatest number of speleothems is known to have come from Postojnska jama 
because of the accessibility and the extent of the cave, the amount of the engineering 
work carried out for the installation of the underground railway, and the vigorous and 
publicity–conscious management from 1818 until the relatively recent onset of 
conservation awareness. Several visitors (travellers), handbooks and archives 
reported about speleothems being sold in front of the caves. In Postojnska jama the 
speleothems for sale were cut in side passages of the cave. As Postojnska jama is the 
most well-known cave the evidences and archives mention mainly this cave where 
the speleothems were sold. Many of the speleothems were taken out of the caves and 
used as souvenirs for important visitors; such reports are from Vilenica and 
Postojnska jama. Several pieces of speleothems of Slovenian caves were also placed 
in museums and other exhibitions all over Europe. A great number of speleothems 
can still be seen as ornaments at important places (stations, parks, avenues, chapels, 
etc.) in several cities. There are also several examples from Slovenian caves where 
the speleothems were placed in European cities. Speleothems are still on the railway 
stations in Seţana and Logatec. The most recent known example of a stalagmite, 
placed on a remarkable place is in Divača when in 2008 the stalagmite erected on a 
roundabout. Speleothems have been also used as memorial monuments. After World 
War II several Partizan monuments were placed on speleothems, such as in Trušnje, 
Krim and Orlek in Slovenia and Sales (Saleţ) in Italy. On the cemetery in Koper a 
1.6 m high and 1 m wide piece of flowstone is used as commemoration of people 
whose ashes have been scattered in the Adriatic Sea near Piran. As the first name 
was placed on the monument in 2006, this is presumably of its erection. A piece of 
flowstone was also used as a memorial monument to France Habe, Peter Habič and 
Ivan Michler, the three karst researchers, and is placed near Vrhnika. The flowstone 
has dimensions 1.8 m x 1.3 m x 0.9 m and was placed in 2008. The flowstone from a 
cave near Gorjansko was used for wall panels and door frames of the National 
46 
Assembly or Parliament building in Ljubljana that was built in the period 1954 – 
1959. Some of the above mentioned examples of flowstone were taken out of caves 
and some from quarries (Shaw, 2010, 207). 
Mankind has been also using caves and their microclimate. Therapeutic effects 
of caves have been discovered empirically. Records on medicinal caves were even 
originated by the men of Middle Age and the first scientific studies were conducted 
in Germany in the 1950’s (Nagy et al., 2008, 222). The use of the climate of caves is 
a not widely known therapeutic measure in the treatment of chronic obstructive 
airway diseases. The treatment has become an official therapeutic measure, accepted 
and assisted by the public health authorities in several countries in Europe (Horvath, 
1986, 90). The microclimate in caves has some passive health–giving factors: 
absence of air pollutants, microorganisms, or allergens in the air; constant 
temperature, humidity, high CO2 level and high salt content of the air (Horvath, 1986, 91; Nagy et al., 2008, 222); and the environment is low in extensive stimuli. 
The most important factor which has an active health–giving effect is high vapour 
content (Horvath, 1986, 91). 
7.5 Caving, speleology and karstology as a science 
“Recreational caving may be defined as the activity of entering a void, such 
as a cave, for pure joy of the activity. It includes sport caving, easy cave recreation 
and visiting caves by large groups. It may overlap with more vocational or 
professional caving purposes when recreational cavers add speleological activities to 
their cave visits or vice versa. These vocational and professional activities may 
include photography, mapping and various cave-related scientific specialties. Cave 
activities or caving have become a subordinate occupation for vocational cavers, who 
give many volunteer hours for the joy of it, as material compensation for caving is 
rare”. (Wilson, 2005, 469) 
There is a special aspect of recreational caving when individuals by chance 
enter a cave with no prior experience or knowledge. Generally they are not informed 
about cave environment. They may put at risk both themselves and the cave 
environment and may indulge in cave vandalism. Some countries developed caving 
47 
codes to avoid the negative impacts and to protect caves. The first was the 
Australia’s Minimal Impact Caving Code (Webb, 2004, 621 – 622). 
There are four distinct motives that have led men to undergo the dangers and 
discomforts of exploring caves: simple curiosity, scientific curiosity, commercial 
exploration, and enjoyment of a challenging sport. The later is of relatively late occurrence, arising only towards the end of the 19th century with the formation of 
cave exploring societies (Shaw, 1992, 5). 
Cave visitation can be influenced by six criteria, according to Wilson (2005, 471 – 
472): 
- Known existence of the cave. The cave must be known to exist, and such 
knowledge is often spread by those taken to caves by previous visitors. 
- Physical access. Factors affecting physical access to a cave might include 
cave gates, barriers, or proactive access control; vertical entrances, water 
barriers, etc. 
- Distance to cave. With all other factors being equal, the farther a cave is 
from a given starting point, the less likely it is to be visited. The 
percentage of the population who has caved is higher in communities 
located in karst areas than in areas more distant from suitable caves. 
Although many very experienced cavers travel all over the world to go 
caving, recreational cave trips tend to be to caves that are relatively 
nearby. The higher percentage of existing caves has been discovered in 
areas that are easy to access. 
- Caver appeal. Popular caves have one or more interesting features that 
appeal to the caver, such as significant size and complexity, aesthetics, 
unique or unusual geological features, interesting biota, fun caving 
features, caving challenges, or cultural mystique. The attractiveness of a 
cave to cavers often depends on the degree to which cavers can physically 
go. 
- Suitability for group caving. Almost all recreational caving is done in 
groups of 3 to 30 people. Caves without places where people can stop and 
socialize or at least communicate are noticeably visited less often by 
recreational cavers. 
- Legal access to the caves. Some of the caves are closed or have a 
limitation on access. 
48 
The most common activities of cavers are: 
- exploring new caves or exploring new passages in known caves; 
documentation of caves: photographing, surveying and mapping, 
- visiting caves within cave excursions or educational programs in clubs 
(educating about caves and karst), 
- cave rescue activities. 
Cave exploration and documentation remained the realm of scientists and speleologists until the end of the 19th century. Since the latter part of the 20th century 
there has been a steady increase in what is now called recreational caving. By the start of 21st century, speleology, cave exploration and recreational caving were all 
well established throughout the world with a huge range of clubs to cater for their 
different needs. The societies were mainly interested in the discovery and exploration 
of new caves and they published their results, often with surveys of the caves. Most 
of them were interested to some degree in the specialist scientific aspects of caves, as 
well as in accurate surveying and recording. But all of them were (and still are) 
entirely amateur organizations, although some members of the society may be 
professional speleologists. The link between amateur’s recreational cave exploring 
and the work of professional scientist is often close and sometimes indistinguishable 
(Shaw, 2004, 351). 
The motives and purposes of cave exploration have been changing through 
the centuries on the Kras as may be the same also in other karst regions. 
Until the middle and late 19th century when the cave societies were founded, 
show caves were visited mainly by foreign travellers, who were of higher society and 
mainly of middle age as the travelling was affordable only to upper class. Many of 
the visitors were scientists. 
In the middle and late 19th century when the caving in the wider area of the 
Kras spread, the main motive of cave exploration was the exploration of possible 
water sources for the growing city Trieste. In this context caves Škocjanske jame and 
Abisso di Trebiciano (Labodnica) were explored. In this period until World War I 
cave explorers were educated men from the cities of the Austrian Monarchy (such as 
Trieste, Wien and Brno) and local men who were employed as cave workers. Their 
role was to accompany the “researchers”, to explore caves, to work in caves (digging 
the paths) and to guide visitors through the caves. The locals were from the village 
49 
where the cave is located and not from distant villages. The explorers, known as 
scientists, were mainly of the middle age; the locals were of middle age as well, 
although there were also some younger people also working in caves. The cave 
societies that were founded on the pure Slav territory (Anthron in Postojna and 
Društvo za raziskavanje jam in Ljubljana) also had the same structure of the 
members. In the society Anthron the founders were local men but later they were 
cooperating with scientists. The same situation was in Ljubljana where Putick needed 
assistants for his scientific work. Great explorations in Škocjanske jame contributed 
to the popularity of caving in Trieste, mainly among the students, and student caving 
groups were founded. 
During World War I and II the explorations were mainly cancelled. 
After World War II the new border, part of the Iron Curtain, arose and the situation 
in general changed significantly. The greatest part of the Slovenian Kras became part 
of Yugoslavia, while one third remained in Italy. In that period several caving 
societies and clubs were founded in Slovenia. Different political and economical 
regimes on either sides of the border influenced also caving. Cavers in Italy had 
better conditions for buying cave equipment and being in touch with the 
development of cave techniques, while the Slovenian (in that time Yugoslavian) 
cavers had a lot of home–made equipment. Cavers from Slovenian part of the Kras 
were in advance as they bought the equipment in Trieste and smuggling it over the border. The structure was rather different as in the societies from the 19th century. It 
was only in Ljubljana that members were highly educated and students; in most 
societies (e.g. Seţana, Logatec) members were of vocational education and middle 
class (Jakofčič, 2011; Mihevc, 2011b). In Trieste there were several caving groups 
and thus some of them were of a particular structure (for example students or 
academics). After World War II the main purpose of caving on the Kras – the 
exploration of underground Reka – has remained, but the aim has changed. In the 19th century the aim of exploration was water sources while after World War II the 
aim has become the underground course itself, to know the unexplored passages. But 
in both cases (even that in the present time, most of the cave explorers are not 
karstologists) the results of cave explorations are indispensable in the science. The 
age of recent active cave explorers has a great range from 18 to more than 60 years. 
It is not to be missed that even though the technique and the equipment has 
developed, the exploration has become more complicated and difficult. The main 
50 
reason for this is that most of the greatest caves (e.g. with simple passages, great 
entrances, etc.) are already discovered and on the Kras in recent times most of the 
new explored caves are those with very narrow entrances. With all the mentioned 
development and with the spread of exploration in the high karst plateaus, such as 
Trnovski gozd, Sneţnik, etc. and in mountains (e.g. Kanin) the deep caves with 
depths more than 1 km demand great efforts physically and psychologically. With 
the wide spread of modern technologies, e.g. digital cameras and the web, mainly 
with the tools that allow the sharing of pictures and films, in the last ten years much 
more documentary material has been taken and shared. Thus caves can be widely 
presented to a large public. 
7.5.1 Development of cave exploration societies 
The creation of cave exploration societies has had three main effects: 
1. They bring together people with similar interests, stimulating deeper and 
longer – term involvement in the field; 
2. By working together as a group, the members are able to undertake 
explorations that are technically more difficult and physically more 
demanding than those they could have done alone; 
3. Their specialist cave publications not only increase the amount of 
speleological material published, but make it more readily available to people 
who have an immediate interest in it (Shaw, 2004, 350 – 351). 
Most of the cavers are members of cave societies or clubs. Most cave societies or 
clubs are members of national cave associations. “Advances in techniques for 
exploring caves have been such that clubs are less important than they once were as a 
source of communal equipment, but they remain important for training in the 
practical aspects of caving and installing a respect for the cave environment” (Webb, 
2004, 621). The locations of cave exploration societies are determined by the 
geography of the major karst areas and the presence of a sufficiently large educated 
population in or near the karst area (Shaw, 2004, 350 – 351). 
Some of the earliest speleological groups were the offshoots of 
mountaineering clubs. The earliest known cave society was the Höhlenklub of 
Appenzell in eastern Switzerland, which existed in the early 1860s. There is very 
little known about it and no records or publications are kept. The first real 
51 
speleological group was the Verein für Höhlenkunde, founded in 1879 in Wien by 
Franz Kraus. The next year the world’s first speleological periodical of this group 
was published (Literatur – Anzeiger). Soon after the formation of the group it 
became part of the Österreichischen Touristenclub as a separate Sektion für 
Höhlenkunde. Its new publication, the Mittheilungen, recorded the scientific work of 
its members and was the earliest conventional speleological journal. A Karst 
Committee formed within the Sektion adopted a semi – professional approach to its 
work. 
On the today’s Slovenian and Italian territory the first cave group was the 
Sektion Küstenland des Deutschen und Österreichiscen Alpenvereins 
(further:D.Ö.A.V.). It had been set up in 1873 but the Grottenabteilung was created 
later, in 1883. Grottenabteilung was noted for the very difficult explorations that it 
carried out, including the explorations in Škocjanske jame and Kačna jama. The first 
Italian cave society that worked on the territory of today’s Italy and Slovenia was 
Società degli Alpinisti Triestini, founded in Trieste in 1883. There were 73 founder 
members and the number soon grew to over 100. A subsection for caves, 
Commissione Grotte, was formed. They explored caves Grotta Gigante (Velika jama 
v Briščikih), Abisso di Trebiciano (Labodnica) and others. In 1885 the society 
merged with the still-existing Società Alpina delle Giulie (further: SAG). The total 
number of caves explorers rose from 4 in 1883 to 230 by 1900. The caves were 
recoded systematically and allocated catalogue numbers (Shaw, 2004, 350 – 351). 
In 1889 the first purely Slav cave society was formed. The group was called 
Anthron and its main discoveries were in Postojnska jama system (Shaw, 2004, 350 – 
351). The society was established after the successful explorations in Škocjanske 
jame by the citizens of Postojna. Their precursors subscribed in Predjama as 
Slovenski gadi on May, 11, 1882 (Šajn, 1988a, 7). The cave society was founded in 
1889 when the locals explored the entrance into Otoška jama cave. One of the main 
tasks of the society was to set the cave for the visitors, but soon the main task 
became the cave exploration (Kranjc, 1988a, 13). Members of Anthron were 
exploring Postojnska jama, and in 1893 together with E.A. Martel, W. Putick and F. 
Kraus. They explored the underground Pivka river to the sump in Magdalena jama. 
One of the most important achievements of the society was the discovery of the 
passage Lepe jame in Postojnska jama in 1891 (Šajn, 1988a, 7). The society ended 
52 
with its exploration at the end of the 19th century or at the beginning of the 20th 
century (Kranjc, 1988a, 14). 
Great explorations in Škocjanske jame consolidated the prestige of Trieste in 
international speleology. These explorations caused the increase of popularity among 
the youth. After 1890 the activities of several groups of grottisti arose (Galli, 2000, 47 – 48). The growth of caving clubs or societies rose also in the 20th century and it 
has included many of them which are concerned solely with the sporting side of cave 
exploring. The vast increase in the number of societies is the result of many causes, 
including increased population, a larger proportion of people living in cities, the 
higher public profile of caving in the media, and the presence of even more clubs 
attracting recruits (Shaw, 2004, 351 – 352). 
In Italy the law that founded the “Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro” was 
declared in 1925. The aim of dopolavoro was to promote the health and good in the 
spare time of the workers within the institutions and initiatives, directed to develop 
moral, intellectual and physical capacities in the Fascist Revolution (OND, 2011). 
All the amateur organizations had to become dopolavoro. The organizations that 
took part in any of competition became members of the Comitato Olimpico 
Nazionale Italiano (further: CONI). Club Alpino Italiano (further: CAI) became 
member of CONI and thus also SAG as its member. All other cave organizations had 
to become dopolavoro and thus members of cave societies XXX Ottobre and Prez 
joined to SAG some years later (Sancin, 2011). In those yeas there were also several dopolavoro cave societies that were founded in the 30s of the 20th century but are 
long inactive (GGEB, 2011). 
7.5.2 Development of cave societies in Slovenia and Italian Classical 
Karst in the 20th century 
The society Društvo za raziskavanje jam Slovenije was founded on 12 May 
1910. Later, it was divided into several sections – in Idrija, Koper and Ribnica 
(Bohinec, 1959). 
In the following year several other cave sections were founded (Savnik 1961, 
36). The reason for founding cave society in Ljubljana was to help to V. Putick at his 
scientific work as he needed assistants. In the surrounding karst areas and in Trieste 
cave societies had already had a long tradition. Several young men who joined the 
53 
society were doing the explorations, first in the Dolenjska region to explore caves 
with underground courses and tributaries of the Krka river. The committee bought 
common equipment – safety ropes, ladders from wire rope, carbide lamps and a light 
winch. The members used their own clothes, mountain ropes, photo material and at 
the beginning bicycle acetylene lamps. Later on the explorations took place in the 
wider area of the Dolenjska region, in the catchments area of the Ljubljanica river 
and in today’s Croatian Istria (Kunaver, 1961, 6 – 11). 
During World War I the activities ceased. In 1917 P. Kunaver and Michler 
continued with exploration on Trnovski gozd plateau for the military purposes and 
explored around 100 caves (Kunaver, 1961, 6 – 11). In the period before World War 
I the technique was mountaineering as the members were all from mountaineering 
society. After World War I the society began with the activities in 1925. The 
explorations were mainly in the karst area between Ljubljanica basin and Planina 
polje and to the former Yugoslav – Italian border. The activities of the society were 
cancelled also during World War II and explorations started again in 1945. In 1962 
all the sections and clubs joined in the society Društvo za raziskavanje jam Slovenije 
(Habe, 1971, 16 – 17). 
At present there are 45 cave societies (clubs) which are members of the 
association, Jamarska zveza Slovenije (further: JZS). In the region Friuli – Venezia – 
Giulia (Furlanija – Julijska krajina); further: FVG (FJK)) in Italy the main 
speleological organization is Federazione Speleologica Regionale di Friulia – 
Venezia - Giulia, established in 1997. Almost all active caving societies are members 
of the federation. There are 26 societies in 4 provinces (Gorizia, Pordenone, Trieste 
and Udine) – of all 28 caving societies. In the province of Trieste there are 10 
societies in the Federazione Speleologica Triestina, established in 1957 (Fed. Spelo. 
Reg. FVG, 2009). Members of Federazione Speleologica Triestina are: Associazione 
XXX Ottobre CAI – Gruppo Grotte, Commissione Grotte Eugenio Boegan, Gruppo 
Grotte Carlo Debeljak, Športno društvo Grmada – jamarski odsek, Jamarski odsek 
Slovenskega planinskega društva Trst, Gruppo Speleologico Flondar, Gruppo 
Sepelologico San Giusto, Gruppo Triestino Speleologi, Società Adriatica di 
Speleologia and Raggruppamento Escursionisti Speleologi Triestini (Federazione 
Speleologica Triestina, 2010).
