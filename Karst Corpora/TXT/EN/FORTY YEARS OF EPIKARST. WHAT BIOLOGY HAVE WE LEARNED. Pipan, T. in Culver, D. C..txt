      Abstract:       Epikarst  is  not  only  an  important  component  of  the  hydrogeology  of  karst  and  an  active  
                      site  of  speleogenesis,  it  is  habitat  for  a  number  of  species  adapted  to  subterranean  life.  
                      Water  in  epikarst,  with  a  residence  time  of  days  to  months,  is  a  highly  heterogeneous  
                      habitat, and the animals are primarily sampled from continuously sampling dripping water  
                      or collecting from residual drip pools. While the subterranean fauna of cracks and crevices  
                      has  been  known  for  over  100  years,  it  is  only  in  the  past  several  decades  that  epikarst  
                      has  been  recognized  as  a  distinct  habitat,  with  reproducing  populations  of  stygobionts.  
                      Dissolved organic carbon in epikarst drip water is a primary and sometimes the only source  
                      of organic matter for underlying caves, especially if there are not sinking streams that enter  
                      the cave. Typical concentrations of organic carbon are 1 mg L-1 . The fauna of epikarst is  

                      dominated  by  copepods,  but  other  groups,  including  some  terrestrial  taxa,  are  important  
                      in  some  areas.  Most  of  the  diversity  is  β-diversity  (between  drips  and  between  caves).  
                      In Slovenia, an average of nearly 9 stygobiotic copepod species were found per cave. In  
                      studies in Romania and Slovenia, a number of factors have been found to be important in  
                      determining species distribution, including ceiling thickness, habitat connectivity and habitat  
                      size. In addition to eye and pigment loss, epikarst copepod species may show a number  
                      of specializations for life in epikarst, including adaptations to avoid displacement by water  
                      flow. Several geoscientists and biologists have challenged the uniqueness and importance  
                      of epikarst, but on balance the concept is valid and useful. Fruitful future research directions  
                      include development of better sampling techniques, studies to explain differences among  
                      nearby epikarst communities, phylogeographic studies, and assessing the possible role of  
                      copepods as tracers of vadose water.

  According  to  Williams  (2008),  the  typical  porosity                 for  karst  development  at  the  surface  as  well  as  at
