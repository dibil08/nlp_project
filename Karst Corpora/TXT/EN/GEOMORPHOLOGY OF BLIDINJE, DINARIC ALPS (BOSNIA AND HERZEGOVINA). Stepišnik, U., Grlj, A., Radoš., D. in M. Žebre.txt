    Blidinje is tectonically derived lowland in the Dinaric Alps within Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is              Received 12 February 2016 
    surrounded by Vran, Čvrsnica and Čabulja Mountains. The Blidinje study area is predominantly                   Accepted 4 May 2016

    1200–1900 m. The map results from a combination of a ﬁeldwork mapping, interpretation of                       geomorphological map; 
    orthophotos and an analysis of a digital elevation model. This map presents a distribution of                  Dinaric Alps; Blidinje 
    landforms    and  sediments    associated   with   the  past  and   present   karst, glacial and  ﬂuvial 
    processes,   such  as  different  varieties  of  karst depressions,    conical  hills, erosional  gullies, 
    alluvial  fans  and  large  amphitheatre-like  moraines.  The  focus  of  the  presented  map  is  to 
    assist ongoing studies in this part of the Dinaric Alps that seek to understand the dynamics 
    of former glaciers and associated palaeoclimate.
