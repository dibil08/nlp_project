Izjavljam da je doktorko delo v celoti moje avtorsko delo. I declare that this thesis is my author work exclusively. 
I dedicate this work especially to my companion Isabela and to who I consider to be my son Bruno, due to the many times when I was absent. Of the several times I have been out, I was asked by my Slovenian friends where was Isabela! And my answer was always that this “holy” companion was not with me in person, but was always by my side in thought. 
On the first trip we did together to Slovenia, we experienced a native fruit from the region which is called Izabela. Since then, whenever I was in that wonderful country, I remembered her by the coincidence of the name and, certainly, by her constant sweetness towards me. 
I also dedicate this work to my family, represented here by my grandparents, my parents and my brother due to the good examples that were set to me and I hope I had followed. 
I make here special mention to my grandfather Ulysses de Oliveira Panisset, whose the name from the Brazilian Army I carry with pride, being also his brother in arms of the Mighty Artillery. By his example and your love to the family I dedicate this work. 
It is also important to remember my other grandfather Dr. João Soares Travassos, medical doctor of the underground workers at the Morro Velho Mine, in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais. While checking some books I came in touch with this picture from May 1980, where I appear with him in the “darkness” of the Maquiné Cave, Cordisburgo, Minas Gerais, the region where I did my Masters 
Here I register my happy record my memories of this and many other happy moments next to him and dedicate this work based also in the underground 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
Some undergraduates learn that, according to the technical guidelines for 
preparing monographs, the acknowledgment is regarded as an optional item. However, I 
believe that for completing researches, dissertations and thesis we are always helped 
directly or indirectly by different institutions and various professionals. Others say that 
it is the duty of the supervisors to help and we should not thank them. However, the way 
I have been oriented by my advisors deserves to be point out. So, I take this as an 
opportunity to register and thank everyone who, in some way, helped me in this 
academic journey: 
First I thank my Masters Degree advisor, Dr. Heinz Charles Kohler, for his 
teaching about karst and for his friendship and confidence in my work from the moment 
we started our academic journey. 
To Dr. Oswaldo Bueno Amorim Filho I express my gratitude for the constant 
teaching and professional counseling as well as his solid friendship. I told him once and 
I would like to make public that if Alexander von Humboldt is considered the father of 
geography, certainly I think professor Oswaldo as the father of ―my Geography‖; the 
wider Geography such as Karstology that should always seek to integrate knowledge of 
various branches of activity. 
To my Slovenian advisor, Dr. Andrej Kranjc, of the Karst Research Institute my 
sincere recognition and gratitude for all the opportunities given to me, the knowledge 
always shared and, above all, his friendship. His help and support were fundamental to 
complete this thesis and particularly in my instruction as a Kasrtologist. 
To his wife Maja Kranjc, former librarian of the Karst Research Institute, I 
believe that my words here won‘t be totally sufficient to express my gratitude for her 
attention, dedication and commitment in assisting me whenever I needed to ―quarry‖ 
precious books in the Institute‘s library. I also record that, often, this help came from 
her initiative. For this and many other things I am extremely grateful. 
I thank Prof. João Francisco de Abreu (PhD) by his constant support of my 
actions. Your enthusiasm in seeing the name of the Graduate Program in Geography for 
the first time in an important research center help me to continue this journey 
To Dr. José Irineu Rangel Rigotti, coordinator of the Graduate Program in 
Geography and its professors I thank for the support that was always given. 
II 
To Dr. José Flávio my gratitude for the valuable tips in the field of cartography 
that helped me in making the maps presented in the research. His enthusiasms for 
academic research have always shown me the path to be followed. 
Regarding the friends of the Karst Research Institute I can assure that everyone 
had and still has, within their specialties, some degree of contribution in my 
kasrtological education even before our first contact in 2007. They are Dr. Metka Petrič, 
Dr. Franci Gabrovšek, Dr. Nataša Ravbar, Dr. Janez Mulec, Dr. Bojan Otoničar, Dr. 
Stanka Šebela, Dra. Janja Kogovšek, Dr. Tanja Pipan, Dr. Nadja Zupan Hajna, Dr. 
Martin Knez, Dr. Trevor Shaw, Dr. Mitja Prelovšek and the Doctorate student Andreea 
Oarga. To Dr Trevor Shaw, my special gratitude for revising the English language of 
this dissertation. I am very thankful for his effort to help me. 
To Dr. Tadej Slabe, Head of the Karst Research Institute, my special 
appreciation and recognition for the support to all my projects. 
To Dr. Andrej Mihevc, I would like to acknowledge his willingness of sharing 
his ideas, thoughts and the Slovene history in the field works we made together. His 
enthusiasm and consideration to my work certainly deserve to be mentioned. 
To the secretary of the Karst Research Institute, Sonja Stamenković, my thanks 
for her assistance that went beyond her daily obligations at the Institute. 
I also must remember Franjo Drole, for his willingness to take me to areas where 
the karst waters flooded places and rose so much as in 2000. This allowed me to see 
Slovenian geography in its richness! I also thank him for putting me in touch with the 
geologist Franc Malečkar, member of the SpeleoClub ―Dimnice‖ from Koper, Slovenia. 
Franc has become a good friend since then and guided me to Dimnice Jama and Sveta 
Jama, as well as to other surface and underground sites of historical and cultural 
importance. 
To Dr. Arthur Palmer and Dr. Margaret V. Palmer, my sincere gratitude for the 
suggestions given when reading some of my papers and for his generous considerations 
in the letter of recommendation that helped me to be enrolled in the Karstology Program 
at the University of Nova Gorica. 
I thank the friends from the Brazilian Speleological Society (SBE) for the 
support of my projects in the Section of History of Speleology (SHE) and the colleagues 
from the Journal of Research in Tourism and Karst Landscapes from the Tourism 
Section of the SBE for exchange of experiences. 
III 
Last but not least, I thank the financial assistance received by the Fundo de 
Incentivo à Pesquisa from PUC Minas University for the researches in Brazil and the 
Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia 
(Ministrstvo za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo Republike Slovenije) and the 
National Scientific Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts 
(Znanstvenoraziskovalni Center Slovenske Akademije Znanosti in Umetnosti) for 
scholarships in the country. To the Karst Research Institute (Inštitut za raziskovanje 
krasa) I am extremely grateful for being allowed to be hosted in the Institution, sharing 
its facilities while in Slovenia.

The cultural importance of karst and caves 
Abstract: The karst landscape and caves can be perceived by several people in an equally varied way. From laymen to scientists, caves especially assume different meanings according to the historical and cultural conditions of a particular society. Therefore, one can say that the human relationship with caves is not really new in the history of mankind. Also no less new is the motivation for their use as shelters, safe houses and sacred places. Thus caves and karst are important historical and geographic records of specific regions. Often they present common features of various cultures as shown throughout this work. As a general objective of this research, is the investigation of the cultural use of karst and caves based on Cultural Tourism. Through extensive literature review, study of the areas protected by UNESCO, the analysis of the sites visited by Hayes (2005-2009) and the study of four specific cave shrines (two in Brazil, in Minas Gerais) and two in Slovenia-Italy the objective is to undertake a study that helps to promote the dissemination of the cultural use of karst and caves. It is also intended mapping the information and contribute to discussions on the religious use of caves and to insert this topic in the studies of the geography of religion in particular and of the Cultural Geography in general. Sacred and cultural sites occur in a variety of landscapes and, thus, the research should help to start discussions throughout national karstology in a field of study which is still very little researched systematically in Brazil. It is also intended to make a contribution to the union between the preservation of cultural heritage and the conservation of the karst geological heritage and its caves. The work is also based on deeper theoretical issues related to karst landscapes and their relation to the cultural and religious tourism, based on a bibliographical review highlighting the importance of the work of several important geographers who combined the physical and human studies. They were Humboldt, Malte-Brun, Reclus, Nicod, and Gauchon. Thus a timeline was established to the present day. Other naturalists are also mentioned, giving a greater meaning to the cultural importance of karst and caves. The literature review aimed to demonstrate and discuss the applicability of concepts, such as topophilia, topophobia, sacred and profane applied to the karst, linking them to national and international examples. This step was important for the construction of a theoretical base which was essential for the development of the research theme. While developing the work, the researcher introduced the methodology of inventory and quantification for the evaluation of the geomorphological patrimony used by Pereira (2006), and then first applied to the Portuguese karst by Forte (2008) to the Brazilian sacred sites. The results indicate that the cultural heritage of the karst landscape has become a source of distinction in the international and national scientific community, though, little work on the theme is yet made nationally. Equally recent are the works that present the cultural importance of karst and caves. Thus, the issues that were treated in the research should be seen as a contribution to Geography and Karstology, both considered as plural sciences.

Kulturni pomen krasa in jam 
Izvleček: Različni ljudje tudi dojemajo kraško pokrajino in jame različno. Tako za laike kot strokovnjake imajo posebno jame lahko različen pomen glede zgodovinske in kulturne razmere določene druţbe. Lahko rečemo, da odnos človeka do jame ni nekaj novega v zgodovini človeštva. Prav tako ni nova ţelja, da bi človek uporabljal jame za zatočišča, pribeţališča in svetišča. Tako predstavljajo kras in jame pomemben zgodovinski in geografski zapis določene regije. Kot je razloţeno v tem delu, so to pogosto običajni pojavi v raznih kulturah. Splošna tema tega dela je raziskava o uporabi krasa in jam v kulturne namene na osnovi kulturnega turizma. Na osnovi pregleda obseţne literature, preučevanja področij, ki so pod zaščito UNESCO, analize krajev, ki jih je obiskal Hayes (2005-2009) in preučevanja štirih jamskih svetišč, dveh v Braziliji (Minas Gerais) in dveh v Sloveniji ter Italiji, nameravamo napraviti študijo, ki bo pomagala osvetliti in seznaniti z uporabo krasa in jam v kulturne namene. Nameravamo se tudi poglobiti v prostorske informacije in s tem prispevati k razpravam o uporabi jam v religiozne namene in vključiti to snov v študij posebne geografije religije in splošni študij kulturne geografije. Kraji, ki so sveti ali uporabljani v kulturne namene, so v najrazličnejših pokrajinah in to delo naj bi vzpodbudilo razpravo v krasoslovnih krogih po vsej drţavi o tem področju študija, ki je zaenkrat v Braziliji še precej neupoštevano. Namen študije je tudi prispevati k medsebojnemu razumevanju med ohranjanjem kulturne dediščine in kraške geološke dediščine ter jam. To delo temelji tudi na poglobljenih teoretičnih spoznanjih o kraški pokrajini in njenem odnosu do kulturnega in verskega turizma, dobljenih s pomočjo pregleda literature, predvsem del pomembnih geografov, ki zdruţujejo tako fizično kot druţbeno geografijo. To so Humboldt, Malte- Brun, Reclus, Nicod in Gauchon. S tem je tudi vzpostavljena povezava med preteklostjo in sedanjostjo. Omenjamo tudi druge naravoslovce s poudarkom na kulturnem pomenu krasa in jam. Namen pregleda literature je tudi pokazati in razpravljati o moţnosti uporabe na krasu konceptov, kot so topofilija, topofobija, sveto in profano ter jih povezati s primeri iz domovine in tujine. Ta korak je bil pomemben za vzpostavitev teoretičnih osnov, na katerih sloni ta raziskava. V pripravo doktorskega dela smo vključili tudi inventarizacijo in kvantificiranje, s čimer je bilo mogoče ovrednotiti geomorfološko dediščino po metodologiji, ki jo je uvedel Pereira (2006) in jo je prvič uporabil Forte (2008) na portugalskem krasu ter za brazilske svete kraje. Rezultati kaţejo, da je kulturna dediščina na krasu vedno pomembnejša v narodnih kot tudi mednarodnih znanstvenih krogih, čeprav je bilo v Braziliji na tem področju šele malo narejenega. Pravtako so šele novejšega datuma dela, ki potrjujejo kulturni pomen krasa in jam. Tako je treba tudi na rezultate naših raziskav gledati kot na prispevek h Geografiji in Krasoslovju kot multidisciplinarnima vedama. 
Ključne besede: kras, jame, kulturna geografija, geografija religije.

INTRODUCTION 
The uniqueness of the karst reliefs is such that it seems to lack of ordinary laws of erosion (...).To explain these forms it is needed to foresee a whole new group of erosion process. It is not about modifying details in the normal cycle of erosion, but opening a vast parenthesis and leave a place set a part to the “karst reliefs” 
E. de Martonne, 1933 
Object of study 
The karst landscape and its caves may be perceived by many people and in 
varied ways. From the layman to the scientists, especially, the caves have different 
meanings according to the historical and cultural evolution of a society. 
The regions developed in carbonates such as limestone make up about 10 to 15% 
of the Earth‘s surface (Ford & Williams 2007). Williams (2008) also states that karst is 
found mainly in soluble rocks such as limestone, marble and dolomite. However, it also 
can be developed in evaporites (e.g.: gypsum and halite). The carbonatic outcrops comprise about 15,000,000 km2 of the not frozen Earth‘s continental area (11% of area). 
But the underground carbonates involved in the movement of subsurface groundwater 
are considerably higher, perhaps about 14% of the world. 
Thus, a new proposition of these percentages, especially in the rocky outcrops, 
was proposed by Williams and Fong (2008). The new proposal shows that about 12,5% 
of global land surface outcrops have carbonates. The authors emphasize that they try to 
differentiate the areas where the carbonatic rocks are relatively pure and continuous 
from those relatively impure and discontinuous (Figure 1 and Table 1). 
In some degree one can say that all rocks are soluble. So features of micro-scale 
dissolution may be found in ―insoluble rocks‖ as the quartzites and basalts. Although 
showing karstic features, because they are fully formed by dissolution, the landscape in 
which they are inserted cannot be considered karst; it is composed of rocks relatively 
insoluble dominated by features produced by other natural processes (Williams 2008). 
1 
Figure 1 – Spatial distribution of carbonate rocks according to Williams and Fong (2008). Areas in black correspond to regions of relatively continuous carbonatic rocks. Areas in gray correspond to regions abundant in non continuous carbonatic rocks. 
As shown in Figure 1 it is possible to see how distributed karst areas are over 
Earth‘s surface. So it is not surprising that these regions have been used by primitive 
man since the beginning. By the very characteristic of relief, karst areas were ideal to be 
used as shelter and source of natural resources. 
In karst regions, the first human settlements were set up. Around the world one 
can see that whole populations are supplied by karst waters and, in many cultures, the 
caves are still used as places for religious practice, as cultural manifestations and other 
forms of use (Travassos 2007d). 
The study of this peculiar type of relief could be already seen in the works of 
Greek and Roman philosophers as highlighted by Travassos (2007d). Brief descriptions 
of the Classical Karst (Region of the Kras Plateau, Slovenia) have already appeared in works of the 4th century BC, as well in the works of Strabo, Pliny, Polybius, among 
others. In a clear description of a sink and a resurgence, Posidonius of Apameia (135-50 
BC) states that the river Timavus disappeared between the mountains, flowing into an 
abyss and only reappeared at a distance of 130 stadiums, toward the sea (Kranjc 1997; 
Kranjc 2006a; Travassos, Kohler & Kranjc 2006). The Roman geographer Strabo (63 
BC-21 AD) was probably the first to mention Lake Cerknica (Kranjc 2006b).

3 
In the Middle Ages, the Table of Peutinger already showed signs of human 
settlements on the Karst (Figure 2). Evolving with time, the cultural tourism appears in 
the Kras region (even in its primitive form) in Sveta Jama (Holy Cave), in 280 AD and 
at the Landarska Jama (Cave of Landarska) around 888 AD. Countless travelers were 
also attracted by the natural beauty of the Postojnska Jama (Cave of Postojna) and the 
Vilenica Jama (Vilenica Cave). 
Figure 2 – Section of the Table of Peutinger representing the regions of Noricum, Pannonia, Picenum, Etruria, Roma and Africa. Today they are regions of Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Italy and Tunisia. The detail shows the region of Istria (Source: NÜSSLI, 2007). 
Still according to Kranjc (1997, 2006a) and Travassos, Kohler and Kranjc (2006), at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th century, the region of the 
Kras Plateau became popular by the description of geographers, topographers, scholars 
and travelers. This popularity also came in large part because Trieste (Italy) had been 
transformed into a free trade port in 1719. 
Authors continue to demonstrate the importance of the region to karstology 
when they state that many researchers were the pioneers to devote further study to the 
region of Kras. One can mention J.V. Valvasor (1689), Nagel (1748), B. Hacquet 
(1778-1789), and F. J. H. Hohenwart (1830). In the work of Franc Joţef Hanibal 
Hohenwart (1830), it appears for the first time the term ―karstes‖. Geographers and geologists of the 19th century started to use more frequently the term karst and the work 
4 
of Jovan Cvijić (1893) provided the scientific basis of the study Classical Karst, 
followed by Kraus (1894) and Martel (1894), among others. Actually, it is accepted that the word karst appeared much earlier, at least in the 16th century. F.J.H. Hohenwart 
might be the first one who wrote in 1830 that karst is not oly on the Kras Plateau but it 
extends to the Greek islands. 
As one can see by the previous history, the German form ―kars‖ was originated 
in the region of the Kras Plateau in Slovenia. Its origin is believed to be pre-Indo- 
European with the root kar/gar or kara/gara, meaning stone or rocky, respectively 
(Kranjc, 2001). The term Kras is widely used in Slovenia to designate rocky areas or 
those not favorable to agriculture. It is also used to identify some regions of the Dinaric 
Karst characterized mainly by karren fields and dolines. 
Gillieson (1996) states that this peculiar kind of landscape is also commonly 
characterized by having closed depressions, caves and underground drainage. They are 
mainly formed by rock dissolution. According to Sweeting (1972) and Ford (2007), the 
Germanic term (karst) was popularized by the monograph of Das karstphenömen of 
Cvijić (1893). It is used as a worldwide standard, to describe processes of underground 
and superficial rock dissolution and underground systems derived from that process. 
Another scientific group is trying to use the term karst also for landscapes 
developed in other types of rocks than the carbonates. However, it is believed that the 
more appropriate term to use is pseudokarst. This occurs because siliciclastic rocks are 
likely to develop similar formations to the ―Classical Karst‖ (e.g.: dolines, caves and 
underground drainage). They have their genesis in different processes; in these areas the 
dissolution of the rock is less expressive than mechanical processes. In Brazil, examples 
can be found in quartzite and sandstone. 
In this study, the karstic phenomena which are conditioned by specific 
hidrogeochemical processes through water rich in CO2 and naturally acidulated will be acknowledged under its cultural importance. 
The fascinating surface and underground scenario will be studied beyond its 
physical approach. It is important to remember that these features are the legacy of a 
distant past in association with the climatic aspects of the physical environment. Thus, 
according to Williams (2008), it is not always easy to separate the effects of modern 
processes from the old ones. This occurs because it is possible the existence of 
overlapping geological information climatic features experienced millions of years ago.

Such explanations, however, will not be deeply addressed in this work for being outside 
its scope. Lithological, structural and tectonic controls, the geomorphological, 
hydrological and chemical processes as well as the degree of solubility of the rock 
covered in Travassos (2007d) will be addressed when necessary to contextualize the 
main subject under study and thus facilitate their understanding by readers. 
When several authors call attention to the problem of sustainable use of karst 
areas, the cultural and humanistic use is sometimes forgotten. Besides the preservation 
of its physical resources, one must look ahead to its cultural side, also important. 
Understanding how a social group may perceive the karst is often the way for its 
conservation. 
Ravbar (2008) when devoting a book on karst water protection chose an 
epigraph for starting her work that highlights the primary importance of karst areas: 
―Never spit in a well, you may have to drink from it later‖. It was written in 1809 and 
reflects what Humboldt already stated: everything is interconnected, according to the 
classical principle of geographic correlation. 
It is interesting to demonstrate the complexity of this epigraph mentioning 
Williams (2008): much of the circulating water on karst is from meteoric origin (rain 
and snow). Usually it circulates at relatively low depths, although the most deep 
underground water known is to be found at a depth of 2 km (in the Caucasus of Georgia, 
in the Voronja cave). The meteoric water usually has residence time in the underground 
from a few days to a year; but very deep water can circulate in the underground for a 
decade or more. 
Therefore, one can say that the human relationship with the caves is not really 
new in the history of mankind. Much less new is the motivation for its use as shelters, 
hiding or sacred places. Together with mountains, many caves have become important 
points in mythology, and in the creation of legends, myths and for religions. 
About mountains considered to be sacred, Brito (2008) states that due to the 
predominantly Christian context in which we live in the West, a factor that contributes 
to the development of its sacred conception (―things of God‖) happens because many 
biblical passages and figures refer to massive rock formations. 
The same happens to caves. As a consequence of the large number of mountains 
considered to be sacred (in different beliefs), some have caves that are part of their 
6 
history and for this reason they also divide its sacredness. Many, however, are 
considered sacred regardless. They are considered, therefore, part of the religious 
practices of a community, being valued as temples, churches, places for meditation and 
ritualistic practices. 
Brito (2008, 4) also says that ―even a little in depth study of the messages 
contained in the sacred book of Christianity reveals numerous references to hills, 
mountains and elevations: there are cited the Mount Carmel, the Mount Horeb, the 
mountains of Ephraim, the Tabor, the Mount Moriá, among others”. 
Unlike other physical features, caves receive a special treatment in the collective 
imagination of westerners. In the Christian Bible the word ―cave‖ appears many times. 
They were all given the connotation of the hiding places, shelters and graves. The word 
―abyss‖ is also mentioned under the connotation of a bottomless hole in the depths of 
the earth, serving as the abode of evil and to enclose evil spirits (Lobo & Banducci Jr. 
unpublished). 
About natural or artificial caves mentioned in the Bible, one can identify the 
Cave of Machpelah, Adullam and En-Gedi, among others. There often also emerge the 
words cliffs, caves, crevices, grottoes and caves. A survey on the Archaeological 
Encyclopedia of the Holy Land (Negev & Gibson 2003), one can find about 100 entries 
related to the term ―cave‖. Gibson (2008, 110) recalls that ―the first book of Samuel (14: 
25-27) the Sons of Israel  ̳arrive in a bush and there was honey by the floor‘, 
presumably in fissures and cracks in the rocks‖ (Gibson 2008, 110) 
Caves are presented as places of residence (Genesis 19:30, Numbers 24:21, 
Jeremiah 49:16, Obadiah 1:3), of hiding (1 Samuel 13:6, 1 Samuel 14:11, 1 Samuel 
22:1, 1 Samuel 23:29, 1 Samuel 24:3, 1 Kings 18:4, Hebrews 11:38), of rest (1 Samuel 
24:3, 1 Kings 19:9), of burial (Genesis 23:19, Genesis 49:29 -32, Genesis 50:13, John 
11:38) or as places that do not protect an individual against the divine trials (Isaiah 2:10, 
Isaiah 2:19, Ezekiel 33: 27, Revelation 6:15). Abysses or other cavities also emerges as 
prisons (Isaiah 24: 18, Isaiah 51:1, Zechariah 9:11). 
Artificially made caverns are analogous to the small shafts spread over karst 
regions where animals may fall. Moreover, shafts were also seen as the ancient Greco- 
Roman portals which connect the World to the Hell, for example.

Certainly, the collective imagination and the religious significance of caves vary 
according to different religious beliefs. However, common or similar traces may be 
perceived in different cultures. 
More recently, Mihevc (2001) and Ferenc (2005) identify numerous caves where 
atrocities were committed during and after the Second World War. Used as sites for 
mass murders, many of those places today are being made sacred by the construction of 
religious memorials and crosses next to these places (Figure 3). 
Figure 3 – Entrance of the Šemonovo brezno (Šemonovo shaft). On the left, Dr. Andrej Mihevc from the Karst Research Institute. In the region of Logatec, it is believed that almost 600 people disappeared during and after the Second World War (Photo: Luiz E. P. Travassos, 2009). 
According to Kiernan (2003), Christianity, professed by about 33% of the world 
population, may be regarded as the most anthropocentric religion ever, rejecting the 
pantheism and animism for a monotheistic vision. Still, numerous caves or karstic 
features are considered sacred by Christians as the Grotto of Massabielle (Grotto of 
Lourdes), where a Catholic girl (Beernadette Soubirous) is said to have witnessed 
eighteen apparitions of Our Lady in 1858, for example. 
Still according to Kiernan (2003), in Islam (about 22% of the world population), 
the adoration of a particular landscape seems to be unacceptable, although the Cave of 
8 
Hira is very important within that belief. It is believed that it was the place where the 
Prophet Mohammed received the revelations 
In Hindu tradition (15% of the world population), Buddhist (6% of world 
population) and Chinese beliefs such as Taoism and Confucianism (4%), the caves are 
very important places. Native or indigenous communities also identify the caves as 
important places within their local beliefs (3%). For 14% of the world‘s population, 
without specific beliefs but not necessarily completely atheists, caves do not have any 
specific value (Kiernan 2003). 
Thus, one realizes that many caves have acquired deep spiritual significance in 
various parts of the globe. Some carry physical evidence of the adoption of successive 
traditions while in few cases, other areas continue to be shared by different religions. 
In Brazil, of Catholic majority (68.2% of the total population according to 
IBGE), there are cave-churches that influence and, in some way, move the local 
economy and the sector of cultural and religious tourism. 
Especially regarding Catholic manifestation, one can identify the cave-churches 
as analogous to the catacombs used by Christians persecuted by Rome. The Instituto 
Salesiano S. Callisto (2005), the senatorial decree 35 stated the Christian religion as 
―strange and unlawful‖. For Tacitus, it would be ―deadly‖, ―wicked and unbridled‖ by 
Pliny, ―new and harmful‖ for Suetonius, ―mysterious and opposed to light‖ by Octavius 
Minucio. Thus, Catholicism was placed as illegal and persecuted for being considered 
the greatest enemy of the power of Rome, which was based on the old national religion 
and the cult of the emperor, instrument and symbol of strength and unity of the Empire. 
However, the persecution was not always continuous and universal, nor equally cruel 
and bloody. Periods of persecution were followed by periods of relative peace. 
Prohibited from exercising their faith for a long period of time, Christians could 
only be liberated from the ―darkness‖ in 313, when the emperors Constantine and 
Licinius gave freedom to the Church. From this moment on, they were able to erecting 
churches on the surface. Maybe the construction of small altars or artificial caves for 
protection of sacred images comes from the Roman catacombs. 
The space previously with no value becomes important places of devotion for 
pilgrims who, connected with the idea of personal sacrifice, visit such places. In all 
these spaces, a variety of objects and forms are venerated for their beauty, alleged 
9 
miraculous powers and association with local stories. It is believed that the water that 
emanates from rocks allows the healing of a wide range of diseases (Figure 4). 
Thus, the humanistic and cultural studies of karst areas can offer new essential 
theoretical and methodological possibilities to understand better the phenomena of 
pilgrimages or the tourism to cave-churches. Therefore, it is not possible to understand 
these caves only by the inventory, mapping or the simple description of physical 
features. It is important to note that many Brazilian caves are not widely known, and 
others still remain inaccessible to most people. Distant from urban centers, the scene of

darkness provides the emergence and permanence of mysteries that recreate the oral 
tradition, enriching the local stories. 
Brazilian and Slovene Karst Areas 
The Brazilian territory has developed on old geological structures, except for the 
Tertiary sedimentary basins of the Pantanal, in Mato Grosso, the Amazon basin and 
parts of the coast line. Their ages range from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic in the case 
of the meta-sedimentary basins, and the Pre-Cambrian (Archaean/Proterozoic) when it 
comes to the crystalline terrains of the South American Platform. Among these, the 
cratonic areas, the ancient folding belts and the sedimentary basins stand out 
(Schobbenhaus & Brito Neves 2003). 
The Brazilian continental area is 8,5 million km2 and according to Karmann 
(1994) about 5 to 7% consists of karst terrains. The main units are located in the San 
Francisco Craton in the region of Minas Gerais, Goias and Bahia, on carbonatic and 
dolomite rocks of the Upper Proterozoic period. 
Roldan, Wahnfried and Klein (2003) state that the major Brazilian speleological 
provinces would be mainly four: the Speleological Province of the Ribeira Valley 
(located in the southern portion of the State of São Paulo and the western portion of the 
State of Parana), the Speleological Province of the Bambuí (includes SE portions of 
Tocantins State, East-central and SE portion of the State of Goias, West-central and NW 
portion of Minas Gerais and W of Bahia State), the Speleological Province of Una and 
the Speleological Province of Serra da Bodoquena (the largest carbonatic region of the 
State of Mato Grosso do Sul, extending for about 200 km in N-S direction, in the 
southwest of the state). 
With the increase of research regarding Brazilian carbonatic regions, the work of 
Auler, Rubbioli and Brandi (2001) and Auler (2002), identifies at least 14 important 
carbonatic provinces, in addition to less significant occurrences (Figure 5). 
Minas Gerais stands out in the national scenery due to the important occurrence 
of carbonatic rocks and, consequently, the expressive karst areas that are associated with 
it (Figure 6). According to Piló (1997; 1998; 1999) the State of Minas Gerais has around 3 to 5% (17,600 to 29,419 Km2) of that total. 
11

13 
About the Slovene karst, it is possible to say that from its territorial extention of 20,273 km2, 44% are karst areas (Kepa 2001) composed of sequences of different 
formations ranging from the Cretaceous to the Eocene (Otoničar 2007). The Slovenian 
Karst can also be divided into two main units: the Alpine Karst (to the northwest) and 
the Dinaric Karst (to the south). Between them, is still considered to exist an 
intermediate region called Pre-Alpine Karst or Isolated Karst due to the small amount of 
isolated carbonatic rocks (Figure 7). 
Figure 7 – Geological map of Slovenia. 
With the record of some almost 9,000 explored and registered caves, one can 
understand why these environments have played and still play an important role in the 
lives of people including faith, religious practices and superstition. 
Regarding the majority of the Kras Plateau, it is basically composed of 
permeable Cretaceous carbonates and less permeable dolomites. The Eocene flysch in 
the region acts as an important impermeable barrier that surrounds the massive 
14 
carbonate. As to the age of rocks in the region, we can say that it is defined from the 
moment in which they were uplifted above sea level. Most of the Dinaric Karst in 
Slovenia was formed after the Eocene, since there is no evidence of older sediments 
(Mihevc 2007) 
Objectives and work relevance 
To the researchers who work with the environment and, especially, natural 
resources management, it is easy to understand the difficulty between the management 
and sustainable use of nature. Many argue that the tourism sector is among the biggest 
promoters of degradation. However, one can say that tourism done in a responsible 
manner can also act in environmental preservation. 
This complex and multidisciplinary phenomenon, carried by the geography, 
anthropology, economics and sociology, among many other subjects, deserves special 
attention and to be perceived to be really active as a true agent of conservation and 
sustainability. 
In this context, the karst areas appear as sensitive and vulnerable geoecosystems 
to the impacts of tourism. Still, it is not acceptable to believe that the mere prohibition 
of their use for tourism is the only alternative to its conservation. In some cases, drastic 
and unilateral attitudes might impact an entire regional economy causing serious social 
impacts. It is therefore necessary to act with responsibility. 
Regarding the cultural tourism in karst areas, the central focus of this work is its 
cultural and religious usage, exposing the urgent need of changing attitude towards 
these cultural manifestations. 
Cultural tourism or the pilgrimages to caves are no new activity. One can say 
that cultural tourism in karst began in the Middle Ages, when pilgrims sought to know 
sacred caves and underground churches. To Kranjc (1994), perhaps the tourism of 
pilgrimages had begun with the Three Kings who visited the newborn Jesus in a cave 
used as a barn, next to Bethlehem. 
Thus, the caves and the karst are important records of specific historical and 
geographic regions. Often they present common traces in many cultures as will be 
demonstrated with the present contribution. 
15 
In regions that experienced wars, karst and caves (especially shafts) played a sad 
role as they were used as spaces where atrocities were committed. Similarly in history, 
they emerged as places associated with evil, and need to be made sacred. In these places 
where fear prevailed, monuments and oratories were and still are constructed in honor to 
those who perished. This phenomenon can be seen as society strives to overcome the 
traumas experienced by these tragedies. 
As a general goal it is proposed to research the use and protection of karst 
landscape as the basis of Cultural Tourism. Through the survey of protected areas from 
UNESCO and the study of four specific cave-churches (two in Brazil, in Minas Gerais) 
and two in Slovenia-Italy (Socerb and Landarska), the researcher aims to carry out a 
work that contributes for the dissemination of the cultural use of karst areas as well as 
contributing to the discussions on the religious use of caves in the studies of Geography 
of Religion in particular, and Cultural Geography in general. 
Cultural and sacred sites occur in a variety of landscapes and, thus, the 
researcher aims to open a path amidst Brazilian karstology in a field still little explored 
in the country. It is also important that the research can contribute to the union between 
the preservation of karst cultural heritage and geological patrimony conservation. 
Methodological procedures of the research 
The work is fundamented on the deepening of the theoretical thematic related to 
karst landscapes and its relation with the cultural and religious tourism, through an 
extensive bibliographic review. It is shown the relevance of the work of important 
geographers capable of combining the physical and human studies. Humboldt, Malte- 
Brun, Reclus, Nicod and Gauchon. Thus, a sort of time line was organized until the 
present. Other naturalists are also cited, giving greater weight to the cultural importance 
of karst areas. 
Due to the descriptive nature of the studies mentioned here, it was chosen not to 
separate caves as artificial and natural ones. Their differences are well known, however, 
and the separation of these two types of cavities would excessively break the text. Thus, 
one can remember Forti (2003) cited by Forti (2009a, 4) when stating that Speleology is 
possible to develop in ―environments both natural and artificial, both in the surface and 
under it‖. 
16 
The bibliographical review was proposed to demonstrate and discuss the 
applicability of concepts such as topophilia, topophobia, sacred and profane, linking 
them to national and international examples. This was important for the construction of 
a basic theoretical framework, essential for the development of the thematic presented. 
Given the nature of the object of study and the purposes of the dissertation, the 
researcher chose to perform a descriptive and exploratory study, with some qualitative 
and quantitative analysis as proposed by the methodology adapted from Steil (1996; 
2002), Evia Cervantes (2006; 2007) and Barbosa (2007). 
In addition, information were gathered at the library of the Karst Research 
Institute (Slovenia), on cartographic documents regarding world‘s karst areas (Williams 
& Fong 2008), georeferenced satellite images (LANDSAT and GoogleEarth) and radar 
images (SRTM-NASA). Moreover, for the Brazilian case, the cartographic bases were 
used from various government projects. 
Another stage, held between the years 2006 and 2009, was undertaken to 
identify the phenomenon of cultural and religious tourism alternating the presence in 
places of worship and pilgrimage in Antônio Pereira (Lapa of Antônio Pereira, Gruta 
da Lapa or Grotto of Our Lady of Conceição da Lapa) and Vazante (Lapa de 
Pamplona; Pamplona Cave), Minas Gerais Caves and in Socerb (Sveta Jama or the 
Holy Cave) and in Antro (Landarska Jama or Sv. Ivan v Čele (Cave of Landarska or the 
Cave of St. John in the Rock). Here, historical and geographical data were confronted 
with the author‘s field perception on these sites and in others European sacred sites. 
This methodological approach took into account the observation of pilgrims and 
tourists during the celebrations in the Brazilian caves and during the visits to European 
caves. Thus, it was possible to identify how individuals behave in a sacred space. These 
observations are complemented by informal semi-structured interviews with the 
participants - both pilgrims and tourists. The dialogues covered the basic ideas about the 
history of the alleged apparitions or the legends associated with the knowledge of the 
cave and other reports. Consequently, the information presented was based on the 
academic production on the subject and the oral information collected during the field 
work. 
A hundred and thirty questionnaires were applied during the Fiesta of ―Nossa 
Senhora da Lapa‖ in Antonio Pereira. The information gathered from them is not a final 
sampling, however, but a suggestion for future studies. 
17 
It is also intended to introduce the methodology of inventory and quantification 
to the evaluation of the geomorphological patrimony for Brazilian sacred sites on karst. 
The methodology was first introduced by Pereira (2006) and applied for the first time to 
the Portuguese karst by Forte (2008). 
Among the existing methodologies, the one proposed by Forte (2008) was 
chosen because it deals with the inventory of geomorphosites specifically in carbonate 
rocks. It allows the insertion of the human variable in judging its importance for a future 
ranking and better touristic use in caves considered to be sacred. Forte (2008) 
delimitated the area of the Territorial Unit of Alvaiázere in Portugal, and in this 
research, the author intends to perform state and national ranking in the near future. By 
using the methodology of Pereira (2006), with minor adjustments, to the caves of 
religious use in Brazil it is expected to include this variable in national studies. 
Thus, one must continue to demonstrate the importance of uniting the human 
and physical variables in the study of geomorphological sites of cultural importance 
especially in karst areas, applying this methodology for the first time in a carbonate site 
of historical and cultural importance in Brazilian territory.

1. THEORETICAL BASIS 
It is in the elimination of the traditional division between Physical Geography and Human Geography that new types of synthesis may appear 
Chorley & Kates, 1969 
The work was partially developed along the general lines of research of Yi-Fu 
Tuan (1979/2006; 1980; 1983), mainly through the study of the relationship between 
people and nature and the human perception of landscapes, spaces and places. The 
works of Eliade (1956; 1983; 1991; 1994; 1995; 1999) related to religion, the 
imaginary, the symbolism and the relationship between the sacred and the profane 
provided important data for the characterization of the relationship between man and 
caves. 
Being a study that seeks to establish a connection between the touristic use of 
karst and its influence on cultural and regional tourism, the works of Steil (1996; 2003), 
pioneer in the study of the pilgrimages to the Bom Jesus da Lapa cave were used. 
Furthermore, the contributions of the Brazilian Geography of Religion from Gill Filho 
(2001; 2002; 2005; 2006; 2007; 2008), Kozel (2002) and Rosendahl (1996; 1999; 2002; 
2003; 2007) provided important data for the achievement of the objectives proposed by 
the author. 
1.1 Alexander von Humboldt and his physical and humanistic studies of caves 
It is believed that in the physical studies of nature, it is not possible to dissociate 
the figure of Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). If one think upon Geography, this 
separation is even more difficult. Turley (2001) says that many consider him the 
founder of this science, while others call him the most responsible for modern science 
as a whole. 
Kohlhepp (2006) also agree that Humboldt contributed significantly to the 
development and consolidation of Geography as science. Working as a physical 
geographer, he started climatological and phytogeographical studies. Functioning as a 
human geographer he was engaged in relevant geopolitical aspects and the regional 
studies of human geography. Being a cartographer, he represented nature very 
19 
didactically through maps and beautiful profiles. To Amorim Filho (2008), Humboldt 
had a major role among the painters of the ―exuberant tropical New World‖. This 
statement is proven by Diener (2007) that identifies, for example, how his works had influenced the paintings of Rugendas1. 
The naturalist Carl Friedrich Phillipp von Martius (1794-1868), also addressed 
in this dissertation, like many of his time was influenced by Humboldt as well. 
Henriques (2008, 27) reminds us this fact when he says that ―as a European, Martius 
certainly had great curiosity for the Americas, due to the reading of the Humboldt‟s” 
often cited in the journals of his travels to Brazil. 
Tuan cited by Rodaway (2007) notes that Humboldt, while widely known to 
explain the physical world, was among the first to use the representation of landscape 
and poetry to broaden the geographical experience with feeling and emotion. 
Worthy of emphasis was the fact that ―he knew how to combine the 
concentration of its scientific activities and enthusiasm in a clear and communicable 
way‖ (Kohlhepp 2006, 272). In examining his works one can say, without a doubt, that 
he deserves all the ―labels‖ and countless honors awarded. 
Accompanied by the French botanist, Aimé Bonpland, when embarking his 
famous expedition toward Latin America in 1799, he had already considerable 
geographical, chemical, botanical, mineralogical and physical notions. After his return, 
he published several books that raise his name to a place in the history of science. In the 
words of Turley (2001, 22), being tireless as an ―explorer and adventurer, enthusiastic 
student of other sources of information and a skilled observer and writer, Humboldt 
redesigned the geographical perception of the world”. 
He has developed the image of the ―New World‖ in Europe and presented to 
―the European scientific circles, all the facets of the tropics of Central and South 
America, and their differentiations.” (Kohlhepp 2006, 272) 
Riesco Jr. (2004) states that more than any other scholar of his time, Humboldt 
influenced science in several countries. He set new ways and methods of investigation, 
allowing to exceed the limitation comprehension of isolated phenomena, always seeking 
their inter-relationship 
1 Johan Moritz Rugendas, (1802-1858), German painter known for representing the daily life and scenaries of the Colonial Brazil. 
20 
His works are masterpieces of geography, cartography and even literature. Pratt 
(2001, 156) notes that ―while seemed to be taking the project of descriptive science to its 
encyclopedic extreme, Humboldt has always felt uncomfortable with the spiritual and 
aesthetic impoverishment of the scientific speech, with its inevitable tediousness‖. Thus, 
for Ricotta (2003), Humboldt was a scientist concerned about the manner of language 
treatment and its effect on the reader. Detailed descriptions of the landscape and 
processes were done by him, giving rich narratives to the reader. 
His brilliancy was also in his ability to perceive and describe nature. Nearly half 
a century before Darwin, he had sketched ideas that blend with the most modern 
knowledge of biological and geological evolution of the planet; he has anticipated ―so 
prodigiously‖ major theories that would arise and consolidate only during the next two 
hundred years. (Ezcurra 2002) 
Even with all the scientific papers about Humboldt and his research, what many 
don‘t know is his importance to the study of karst and caves. In his ―Personal 
Narratives‖, ―Views of Nature‖, ―Cosmos”, “Essay on the Superposition of Rocks in 
Both Hemispheres”, “Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain” or in “The Island 
of Cuba” he describes caves in massive carbonate and granite outcrops, ponors, and 
minerals. The use of the underground as dwelling places, shelter, spaces for the practice of 
funeral rites or worship of gods are also present in these works. In addition to describing 
the physical aspects of the Cave of the Guacharos, for example, he noted the religious 
rites of the natives who were accustomed to conduct ceremonies at the entrance of the 
cave. Inside the cave they consulted powerful spirits that would intervene against the 
evil spirits that inhabited the darkness. 
During the time that he was in Venezuelan territory, he explored the mountains north of the country, the Llanos2 and the Guyana to the south as much as in San Carlos 
de Rio Negro in the Venezuelan state of the Amazon (Urbani 2003). He also made 
descriptions or references (not so abundant) from caves in Mexico and Cuba. 
2 Los Llanos is a vast stretch of land ranging from the extreme west of the state of Apure to the eastern state of Monagas. It corresponds to almost a third of the Venezuelan territory which is limited to the northern Andes, the central and eastern mountains, and the southern border with Colombia and the Orinoco. 
21 
His activities in the underground had begun in 1790 in the caves of Peak, Eldon 
and Pooles, in England. In the next year he had began his studies at the Freiberg Mining 
Academy. When working in underground mines, he studied their microclimate and 
developed equipment for breathing in confined spaces of hazardous atmosphere. 
(Urbani 2003) 
In the first volume of the Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain and the 
Essay on the Superposition of Rocks in Both Hemispheres, he studied the geology of 
mining districts, describing underground mines in both hemispheres. He compares, 
describes and makes connections with various types of limestone (Humboldt 1811; 
1822a; 1823). His scientific strictness concerning his works can be confirmed in the 
following passage: 
I do not deny the utility of the denominations marine sandstone or marine limestone for local descriptions; but, according to the principles which I propose following in this essay on formations, characterized according to the place which they occupy as the terms of a series, it appeared to me that I ought here carefully to avoid them. (Humboldt 1823, 63) 
Still regarding the underground, but now in natural cavities, he visits caves in 
Europe, in the Carpathian region, France, Switzerland, Poland and Germany, for 
example. Thus, he could carry out comparisons with some of the features found in the 
―New World‖ 
In 1799, when he started his American journey with the Aimé Bonpland, he 
performed many searches that were notable in the history of Natural Sciences. Before 
reaching the ―New World‖, goes to the Canary Islands and explores a cave of ice (the 
Cueva de Hielo) during his climb to Mount Teide in Tenerife. The cave is located 
below the limit of the perpetual snows in this zone. Probably the cold which prevails in this cavern is owing to the same causes which perpetuate the ice in the crevices of Mount Jura and the Apennines, and on which the opinions of naturalists are still much divided. This natural ice-house of the peak has, nevertheless, none of those perpendicular openings, which give emission to the warm air, while the cold air remains undisturbed at the bottom (...) During winter the cavern is filled with ice and snow; and as the rays of the sun do not penetrate beyond the mouth, the heats of summer are not sufficient to empty the reservoir. The existence of a natural ice-house depends, consequently, rather on the quantity of snow which enters it in winter, and the small influence of the warm winds in summer, than on the absolute elevation of the cavity, and the mean temperature of the layer of air in which it is situated (Humboldt 1818, 157-158). 
22 
Also in Tenerife, he mentions the work of O‘Donnel and Armstrong (1806), 
which ―discovered in 1806 a very abundant spring in the Malpays, a hundred toises 
above the cavern of ice, which is perhaps fed partly by this snow.‖ (Humboldt 1818, 
166). He continues saying that ―everything consequently leads us to presume that the 
peak of Tenerife, like the volcanoes of the Andes, and those of the island of Manilla, 
contains within itself great cavities, which are filled with atmospheric water, owing 
merely to filtration.‖ (Humboldt 1818, 166-167) 
In Mexico he identified sources of pure water, which were carried to villages 
through ―long and magnificent ―aqueducts. In other cases, he has identified acid thermal 
springs, some hot, others cold (Humboldt, 1811:146). He refers to the region of Madre 
de Dios Cave as an ―enormous calcareous mass.‖ (Humboldt 1811, 148). 
He shows the unsustainable exploitation of water for the process of 
amalgamation and its possible impacts. He affirms that the miners use the abundant source of Cueva de San Felipe and in the night of February 16th to 17th, the stream had 
been lost. Meanwhile, ―five days afterwards a new spring was found at five leagues 
distance from the cavern, near the village of Platanillo.‖(Humboldt 1811, 283). This 
statement possibly refers to excessive sedimentation of a ponor and its consequent 
deactivation. 
The same event is described in Humboldt (1822a, 228), which continues 
unfolding the importance of the Mexican geological region: There ―exists in this country, between the villages of Chamacasapa3, Platanillo4 and Tehuilotepec5, in the 
bosom of calcareous mountains, a series of caverns and natural galleries, and that 
underground rivers, like those of the county of Derby in England, traverse those 
galleries.‖(Humboldt, 1822a, 228-229). 
He identified in 1822a, other sources of drinking water close to the present-day Mexico City; one on the hill of Chapultepec6 and another in the hills of Santa Fe, near to the mountains that separate the valley of Tenochtitlán7 from the valleys of Lerma and 
Toluca. He affirms that King Charles V of Spain was informed about the source of 
Amilco, near Churubusco, still in the outskirts of Mexico City. The water was piped 
3 Maybe the present-day Chilacachapa, at about 140 km southwest of Mexico City, State of Guerrero. 4 City located at about 66 km to the southwest of Mexico City, State of Morelos . 5 Village in the municipality of Taxco, around 110 km to the southwest of Mexico City, State of Guerrero. 6 Located in the central portion of the State of Mexico (known as Central Mexico). 7 Ancient Capital of the Aztec Empire, located in an island in the Texcoco lake, next to Mexico City. 
23 
from there to the city in ceramic pipes. In San Agustín de las Cuevas8, he said that water 
quality was better. He have also found traces of an ancient aqueduct in the road that 
connects this ―charming village‖ to Mexico City. (Humboldt 1822a). 
Humboldt (1822a) stressed that the observation of water behavior in caves by 
the Jesuits led the monk Francisco Calderon to imagine the execution of an enormous 
engineering project. 
This monk pretended that at the bottom of the lake of Tezcuco9 near the Penol de los Baños there was a hole (sumidero) which on being enlarged would swallow up all the water (...) The monk and Jesuits kept sounding in vain for three months (...) but no sumidero was ever found though even yet many Indians believe as firmly in its existence. (Humboldt 1822a, 102). 
While describing other ponors, he says that they are interesting phenomena, 
relating them to facts already known in other parts of the world: ―Water and sand are 
sometimes thrown out twenty feet high. Similar phenomena have not escaped the 
observation of the ancients who inhabited parts of Greece and Asia Minor abounding 
with caverns crevices and subterraneous rivers.” (Humboldt 1822b, 220) 
He also registered fresh water upwelling in several small coral and sand islands 
during his visit to Cuba. He theorized that perhaps it had some underground 
communication between the limestone formation of the beach that accumulates rain 
water and, by hydrostatic pressure, it emerged from soil (Humboldt 1856b): ―The 
abundance of water that infiltrates through the fissures of the stratified rock is so great 
that, from the hydrostatic pressure, springs are found in the sea at some distance from 
the coast.‖(Humboldt 1856b, 143) 
On another occasion he says that, in San Carlos de Rio Negro, the Venezuelan 
state of Amazon, they had spent a few hours between the rapids of Atures waiting for 
the boat. Much of the river seemed dry and blocks of granite pile over the river bed. The 
river then disappeared inside the caves formed by the collapse rocks; for him, on one of 
them they could hear the water passing beneath their feet. The river seemed to divide 
into multiple branches or torrents, and each of them was seeking to force passage in the 
rocks. In short, Humboldt affirms that they have been perplexed by the lack of water in 
the river bed, the frequency of underground waterfalls, the turbulence and the noise of 
water hitting the rocks and producing foams (Humboldt 1818; 1850; 1852).

In Cuba, on the region of Trinidad, it is possible to see steep carbonatic outcrops 
resembling the mountains of limestone of Caripe, in the vicinity of Cumana10. They also contain great caverns, near Matanzas and Jaruco, where I have not heard that any fossil bones have been found. The frequency of caverns in which the pluvial waters accumulate, and where small rivers disappear, sometimes causes a sinking of the earth. (Humboldt 1822b, 165-166). 
Specifically in the “The Island of Cuba”, he deals with the “sinking of the 
earth” as natural hazards where the “(...) frequency of caverns, in which the rains 
accumulate and the brooks disappear, sometimes causes great disasters‖ (Humboldt 
1856b, 133), in a clear reference to karst subsidence processes. 
In Cosmos, Humboldt speaks about the temperature of ponors or springs of 
thermal waters and its relationship with volcanic areas. His doubts about the 
temperature of these waters in the tropics were extended when he explored the Cueva 
del Guacharo, measuring the air temperature in the external environment (18,5oC), 
inside the cave (18,7oC) and of the underground river (16,8oC), observing its probable 
source in the mountains (Humboldt 1856a). 
On the Island of Cuba, he affirms that the central and western portions of the 
island contain two compact limestone formations: the first presents some resemblance 
to the limestone formation of the Jura and the second resembled the limestone of 
Papenheim. ―All this formation I shall call Güines limestone, to distinguish it from 
another much more modern formation in the hills of San Juan, near Trinidad; whose 
peaks remind me of the limestone mountains of Caripe, in the vicinity of Cumaná.‖ 
(Humboldt 1856b, 133). 
Visiting the peninsula of Araya (Punta de Araya), he makes a geological 
description indicating the presence of breccias or calcareous sandstone, as “a local and 
partial formation, peculiar to the peninsula of Araya, the coast of Cumana and 
Caracas.”(Humboldt 1822a, 10). From Araya, the visit was quickly followed by an 
excursion to the mountains of the Chayma Indians mission, where a variety of 
interesting objects caught his attention. In a convent, located in a narrow valley, it was 
possible to feel a ―cool and delicious climate in the center of the torrid zone.” In the 
region, ―the surrounding mountains contain caverns haunted by thousands of nocturnal 
birds; and, that affects the imagination more than all the wonders of the physical

world.‖(Humboldt 1822b, 1-2). Here one can already noticed the reference to studies of 
the imaginary and the caves. 
After they ―had suffered great fatigue, and were quite drenched by the 
frequently crossing the torrent‖ they reached the caves of Cuchivano. They observed a 
wall of limestone rock that was rising perpendicularly to the height of 800 toises. He 
affirms that it is rare that in an area where the density of vegetation practically covers 
the soil and rocks, it wasn‘t easy to find sections of exposed rock. Finding a piece of 
visible outcrops amidst the thick forest, he perceived two caves opening like fissures 
―unfortunately inaccessible to man (...). We were assured, that they are inhabited by the 
same nocturnal birds that we should soon become acquainted with in the Curva del 
Guacharo of Caripe.‖(Humboldt 1822b, 80-81). 
Regarding mineralogy, near the limestone caves of Cuchivano, he describes 
―rock-crystals, enchased [enclosed] in beds of alpine limestone. They were hexahedral 
prism, (...) perfectly transparent, were solitary, and often three or four toises distant 
from each other. They were enclosed in the calcareous mass, as the quartz crystals of Burgtonna11 and the boracites of Lunebourg12 are contained in gypsum.‖ (Humboldt 
1822b, 80-81). 
Granite caves are described near to the Mission of Uruana, popularly known as 
the village of La Concepcion de Urbana: 
This small village, which contains five hundred souls, was founded by the Jesuits, about the year 1748, by the union of the Ottomac and Cavere Indians. It lies at the foot of a mountain composed of detached blocks of granite, which, I believe, bears the name of Saraguaca. Masses of rock, separated one from the other by the effect of decomposition, form caverns, in which we find indubitable proofs of the ancient civilization of the natives. Hieroglyphic figures, and even characters in regular lines, are seen sculptured on their sides; though I doubt whether they bear any analogy to alphabetic writing. (Humboldt 1852b, 196) 
In Quito and in Peru, he describes the influence of caves in the Quichua 
language to designate the mountain ranges of the region: 
11 Present-day Gotha, Germany. The region is well known for the rimstone pools formed by carbonatic waters. 12 Lüneburg, city in Lower Saxony, arround 45 km SE of Hamburg.

These porphyritic caverns, in the cordilleras of Quito and Peru, bear the Indian name of Machays. It is a word of the Quichua language, called commonly by the Spaniards the Inca ́s language. Thus Callancamachay means ―a cavern as large as a house‖ (...). They are in general of little depth, lined with sulphur, and differ by enormous size of their openings form those which the volcanic tuff present in Italy, at Tenerife, and in the Andes. (Humboldt 1822b, 147). 
In 1865, he identifies an other cavity in granite, the Cueva de Antisana in the 
northern portion of the La Hacienda volcano. The cave, about 16,000 feet above the 
Pacific, was used as a ―base‖ for the observation of the condors which were flying 
above the Andes (Humboldt 1850). 
For what was shown so far, one can mention Rodriguez (2001) who states that of nearly two hundred naturalist travelers who visited Venezuela during the 19th century, 
leaving important historical records on the physical and human geography of the region, 
the name of Humboldt stands out as the most important one. 
His researches in the caves of the ―New World‖ makes Urbani (2003, 55) give 
Humboldt the title of ―father of Venezuelan speleology‖ because it had presented for the 
first time, works on anthropospeleology, biospeleology and regional geospeleology. It 
should therefore be considered the ―scientific traveler by excellence.‖ (Rodriguez 2001, 
238). 
Of all caves described and identified by Humboldt, Urbani (2003) considers the 
Cave of the Guacharos (Cueva de los Guacharos) his best speleological contribution. In 
the cave he studies for the first time biospeleology, geospeleology, anthropospeleology 
and cave climatology. It is interesting to remark that the information gathered about the 
underground microclimate from the Guacharos remains practically the same as it was 
200 years ago. (Urbani 2003) 
This enchantment with nature, described in the previous pages, should be a 
source of inspiration for the karstologist never, however, forgetting the scientific rigor. 
This is how Humboldt wrote his works giving the readers the possibility of mental 
image construction very close to reality, going from the Physical Geography to the 
Human Geography. 
For him, in South America there was a kind of communion with nature and the 
spiritual life of man, being easy to impress with its sense of greatness; nowhere else in 
the world could one see this relationship so powerfully as in the tropics. (Humboldt 
1850)

Regarding the unknown and the mysteries involving certain caves, Humboldt 
(1818/1852b) says that some travelers, not familiar with flammable natural gases 
expelled from the Cueva del Serrito de Monai, were frightened by indigenous people that light up the gas combination constantly accumulated at the top of the cave13. Urbani 
(2003) also notes that, in the vicinity of Cumana, the local population reported to 
Humboldt that this phenomenon is also repeated in the Cueva del Cuchivano where the 
flames could be seen at a reasonable distance. Such phenomena have also been 
documented in several other parts of Venezuela. 
Humboldt (1850) already identified examples of spaces full of symbolism, as 
places for the practice of sacred ceremonial burials. In the Cueva del Ataruipe, he brings 
to the reader an image of six hundred well-preserved skeletons placed inside palm-leaf 
baskets (Humboldt 1850), confirming the sacredness of the cave. 
On another occasion he realized the importance of the collective imagination for 
the preservation of a bird species in the Cave of the Guacharos. He was able to describe 
to the reader that the guacharos would have been extinct years ago if the natives were 
not superstitious. Their beliefs prevent the natives from going to the darkest places of 
cave, where other nests are made (Humboldt 1852). This gives the birds time to 
reproduce. 
Another interesting phenomenon capable of scaring naive travelers, but not the 
experienced boat drivers of the ―New World‖, was described: ―I have observed the same 
phenomenon on several coasts, for instance, in the promontories of Tenerife, in the 
limestones of the Havannah, and in the granite of Lower Peru, between Truxillo and 
Lima.‖ (Humboldt 1829, 393). He was referring to the high noise, like a snoring, issued 
periodically by the compression of air by the sea waves in a cave. 
In the Canary Islands, he mentions the existence of the Guanche mummies that, 
unlike other natives, ―lived in caves.‖ (Humboldt 1814, 83). About the mummies, he 
says that they are ―the mark of a great civilization‖, and he was amazed by finding them 
even with the presence of ―mercantile nations, especially the Spaniards and the 
Portuguese, sought for slaves at the Canary islands.‖ (Humboldt 1814, 274). Later in 
13 The fire occurs due to the accumulation, mainly of methane gas originated from the organic-matter decay. A legend associated with a region of the interior of Bahia (Brazil) will be described in another section and may be related, perhaps, to the same phenomenon. 
28 
the same work, he demonstrates the importance of the caves for the preservation of 
mummies: 
At the time I visited the Canaries they were very scarce; a considerable number, however, might be found if miners were employed to open the sepulchral caverns which are cut in the rock on the eastern slope of the Peak, between Arico and Guimar. These mummies are in a state of desiccation so singular, that whole bodies, with their integuments, frequently do not weigh above six or seven pounds; or a third less than the skeleton of an individual of the same size, recently stripped of the muscular flesh. The conformation of the skull has some slight resemblance to that of the white race of the ancient Egyptians; and the incisive teeth of the Guanches are blunted, like those of the mummies found on the banks of the Nile. (Humboldt 1814, 278-279). 
On the islands of Cuba, San Domingo and Jamaica, he inquires where would be 
―the abode of the primitive inhabitants of those countries?” (Humboldt 1814, 274). He also states that the Guanches, like the Biscayans14, the Hindus, the Peruvians, and all 
primitive nations, named places after the quality of the soil, the shape of the rocks, the 
caverns that gave them shelter, and the nature of the tree that overshadowed the springs 
(Humboldt 1814), showing among other subjects, the importance of karst and caves as a 
valued space by many cultures. 
In plain of Maita (Venezuela), some piled blocks of granite formed a kind of 
cave. It was called the home or abode of the Tamanacs ancestors. (Humboldt 1818; 
1827; 1852). 
The Cave of Ataruipe, celebrated by the Atures as a place of ceremonial burials 
was magnificently described as follows: 
In this tomb of a whole extinct tribe we soon counted nearly six hundred skeletons well preserved, and regularly placed. Every skeleton reposes in a sort of basket made of the petioles of the palm-tree. These baskets, which the natives call mapires, have the form of a square bag. Their size is proportioned to the age of the dead; there are some for infants cut off at the moment of their birth. We saw them from ten inches long, the skeletons in them being sent together. The bones have been prepared in three different manners, either whitened in the air and the sun, dyed red with anoto, or, like mummies, varnished with odoriferous resins, and enveloped in leaves of the heliconia or of the plantain-tree. The Indians informed us that the fresh corpse is placed in damp ground, that the flash may be consumed by degrees; some months afterwards it is taken with sharp stones. (Humboldt 1852b, 483) 
For the naturalist, the Atures almost completely disappeared; most were not 
anymore known, except for the graves described. They resemble those of the Guanches,

found in Tenerife. In the caves, where the mummies and skeletons of the Atures were 
discovered, the natives had also discovered iron boxes containing numerous European 
tools, remnants of clothing and rosaries (Humboldt 1818; 1827; 1850; 1852). Would 
this be a brief evidence of religious use of caves in the ―New World‖? 
The conflict also observed nowadays about the ―profanation‖ of sacred sites, 
even for archaeological research, was registered by the researcher when describing that 
they left ―the cave at nightfall, after having collected to the extreme annoyance of our 
Indian guides, several skulls and the perfect skeleton of an aged man.‖ (Humboldt 
1850, 172). Unfortunately, the skeleton along with much of its collection of natural 
history was lost in a shipwreck on the coast of Africa. 
Still showing the importance of Humboldt for the development of karstology or 
speleology in Latin America, it is interesting to highlight a little known letter from 1810 
which Urbani (1996) describes and publishes. In the letter sent to Paris to Mr. Louis 
Mathieu Langle (member of the Institute of the Imperial Library of Paris), Humboldt 
was seeking for explanations about the meaning of petroglyphs found by Father Ramon Bueno in a cave of Uruana15, Venezuelan state of Bolivar. Based on Urbani (1996) we 
identified the texts of Humboldt which the specific mention of such petroglyphs. 
The priest Bueno and Humboldt met in 1800 while he was collecting turtle eggs 
from an island in the Orinoco River (Isle of Cucuruparu or Boca de Tortuga). Talking 
to the missionary, that claims to he had discovered a cave covered with ―figures or (as 
he would say in Portuguese) verias letters.‖(Humboldt 1827, 594). To them, the 
characters discovered by Father Ramón are similar to an alphabet, however they still 
had ―many doubts.‖ (Humboldt 1827, 595) 
Regarding the development of these petroglyphs in granite and not in limestone, 
Humboldt makes an interesting observation: ―whatever may be the meaning of these 
figures, and with whatever view they were traced upon granite, they do not less merit 
the attention of those, who occupy themselves with the philosophic history of our 
species.‖(Humboldt 1827, 595). The expression ―with whatever view [they] were traced 
upon granite‖ is perhaps a confirmation of the fascination usually caused by karst 
landscapes on travelers.
