                 elcome to San Salvador, the landing place of Christopher Columbus in 1492. That event changed the world - what changes  
                 in speleological thought will result from this meeting of minds in a very special karst environment?  San Salvador is a  
     Wsmall island on a small platform.  Everything we see in terms of geology and karst had to happen in a constrained area  
     in a very brief amount of geologic time.  This compression in space and time provides a useful setting to explore how speleogenesis  
     works. 

     The Hypogene Cave Morphologies conference is being held at the Gerace Research Centre (GRC) February 2-7, 2014.  In keeping  
     with the tradition of prior Karst Waters Institute meetings, the goal is creative interactions between engaged researchers.  The main  
     thematic activities of the conference are to examine and discuss the unique cave morphologies and speleogens associated with hy- 
     pogene caves, from the scale of 100 km+ cave maps down to centimeter size wall rock shapes and forms.  Hypogene caves can be  
     argued to represent a laminar flow regime that is quite different from the turbulent flow found in epigenic stream caves coupled to  
     surface hydrology.  Can these morphologies be uniquely characterized to identify hypogene caves?  What effect do these laminar flow  
     regimes have on geochemical models of dissolution drive in hypogene settings?  Do flank margin caves fall in the hypogene flow  
     environment? 

     The conference begins with an optional visit to two very large but easily accessible flank margin caves on Eleuthera Island that have  
     a broad suite of morphologies commonly associated with hypogene caves.  The field trip will also visit two other sites that bring into  
     question the separation of pseudokarst sea caves from coastal dissolution caves.  The main part of the meeting is a field conference,  
     with on-the-ground activities every day.  Evenings and two half-days are devoted to sessions; with posters being displayed during the  
     evening social hour. The first day field trip establishes the geologic setting of San Salvador, so that the caves and karst seen on the sec- 
     ond day can be understood in the tight time and space constraints of the island.  These constraints help illuminate possible mechanisms  
     of cave formation in this environment.  Lighthouse Cave, the largest flank margin cave on the island, is visited the third day, and the  
     last day has a series of optional field trips in the afternoon. 

     About 30 invited participants from 13 countries, all of whom have demonstrated interest and expertise in hypogene caves, are partici- 
     pating.  This volume presents their written contributions as abstracts and papers.

     or rather, difference in focus, between the “classic” hydrogeol-                     hypo- (from Greek) - under, below;

         n The Bahamas, caves and blue holes provide clues to the geologic and climatic history of archipelago but are now emerging as  
         windows into the ecological and cultural past of islands. Cave environments in The Bahamas alternate cyclically between vadose  
     Iand phreatic conditions with sea-level change, thereby providing unique but ephemeral fossil capture and preservation condi- 
     tions.  

     A diverse assemblage of fossil plants and animals from Sawmill Sink, an inland blue hole on Abaco Island in the northern Bahamas,  
     has revealed a prehistoric terrestrial ecosystem with exquisitely preserved fossil assemblages that result from an unusual depositional  
     setting.  The entrance is situated in the pine forest and opens into a flooded collapse chamber that intersects horizontal conduits at  
     depths to 54 meters. The deepest passages are filled with sea water up to an anoxic mixing zone at depths of 14 to 9 meters and into the  
     upper surface fresh-water layer. The collapse chamber is partially filled with a large talus pile that coincides with an anoxic halocline  
     and direct sunlight for much of the day.  

     During glacioeustatic sea-level lowstands in the late Pleistocene, Sawmill Sink was a dry cave, providing roosting sites for bats and  
     owls. Accumulations of bones deposited in depths of 25 to 30 meters were subsequently preserved by sea-level rise in the Holocene.  
     The owl roost deposits are dominated by birds but also include numerous small vertebrate species that were actively transported by  
     owls to the roost sites.  

     As sea levels rose in the Holocene, Sawmill Sink became a traditional passive pitfall trap. Significant quantities of surface derived  
     organic material collected on the upper regions of the talus at the halocline where decaying plant material produced a dense layer of  
     peat within an anoxic mixing zone enriched with hydrogen sulfide. Vertebrate species that drowned were entombed in the peat, where  
     conditions inhibited large scavengers, microbial decomposition, and mechanical disarticulation, contributing to the superb preserva- 
     tion of the fossil assemblage in the upper regions of the talus. 

     Exquisitely preserved vertebrates include the Cuban crocodile Crocodylus rhombifer and the tortoise Chelonoidis alburyorum, flight- 
     less birds, and other fossils with ages ranging from 4000 to 1000 years.  Because many species are now extinct or no longer occur  
     in The Bahamas, current studies are attempting to resolve the degree to which prehistoric human settlement affected the Bahamian  
     terrestrial flora and fauna.

        peleogenesis in iron ore caves may involve generation of  
        porosity  at  depth  with  a  later  surficial  phase  associated  
        with  slope  hydrological  processes.  The  earlier  phreatic  
 S 
phase results in morphological features similar to but much more  
irregular at wall and ceiling scale than what is observed in hypo- 
gene caves. Processes responsible for the generation of caves do  
not seem to follow normal karst geochemical paths, but instead  
occur through bacterially mediated redox reactions. 

INTRODUCTION 

Caves and small voids in iron-rich rocks have been reported in  
the  Brazilian  geological  literature  since  the  19th  Century,  but  
only  recently,  due  to  the  expansion  of  iron  mines,  have  they  
been subject to detailed studies. Initial research was performed  
by American geologists from the United States Geological Sur- 
vey in the Iron Quadrangle region of southeastern Brazil, with  
George C. Simmons providing pioneering insights on cave gen- 
esis and mineralogy (Simmons, 1963; 1964). Since 2005, with  
the increase in iron ore prices and the regulatory mandate to as- 
sess the significance of any void over 5 m in length, intensive  
research has resulted in the identification of approximately 3,000  
caves, the majority of them being located in the two major iron  
ore provinces, Carajás ridge in northern Brazil (Amazonia) and  
the Iron Quadrangle area (Fig. 1). Cave mapping and geospele- 
ological studies have provided new insights on the morphology  
and genesis of these enigmatic and little known caves.

Differentiating Between Hypogene and Later  
Modification Features 

In the “hypogene” category we include morphological features  
that  are  interpreted  as  being  generated  deep  below  the  water  
table. As previously mentioned, later slope processes result in  
a more elongated pattern that considerably masks the original  
morphology. Among  these  later  vadose  processes  one  can  in- 
clude the alignment of the cave with the slope gradient, its close  
proximity to the surface and the existence of smaller passages  
linking rounded irregular chambers (Fig. 4). Furthermore, small  
channels mostly at the contact between floor and walls are quite  
abundant, but probably represent later generated inlets related  
to the expansion of the cave along the slope allowing the input  
of fine grained altered iron sediment. Ubiquitous breakdown is                  Figure 3. Schematic evolution of iron ore caves. A. Isolated vugs

     DISCUSSION 

     Void  generation  at  depth  in  iron  ore  areas  involves  chemical/ 
     microbiological removal and transformation of iron constituents  
     (besides silica), resulting in a highly irregular array of non-con- 
                                                                                 Figure 5. Example of a once entranceless cave in the Iron Quad- 
     nected  voids  of  various  sizes,  commonly  intersected  by  bore-        rangle. The later connection is suggested by the constricted na- 
     holes at depths up to several hundred meters below the surface.             ture of entrance. 
     Speleogenetic processes present similarities to hypogene settings  
     in the sense that initial rock porosity is generated at depth, with  
     no  influence  from  surface  processes.  Sluggish  water  flow  and  
     lack  of  connectivity  between  pores  result  in  irregular  isolated  
     chambers, similar to flank margin cave morphology (Waterstrat  
     et al., 2009). Even taking into account the very long timescales  
     (on the order of hundreds of million years) available for speleo- 
     genesis in iron ore regions, the more chemically resistant nature  
     of iron formations result in much smaller voids and caves when  
     compared to carbonate settings. 

     Iron  ore  caves  do  not  display  the  integrated  nature  of  many  
     hypogene  caves,  with  ramiform  or  spongework  caves  (sensu  
     Palmer,  1991)  being  unknown,  although  the  small  size  of  the  
     caves would make the recognition of such pattern difficult. Un- 
     like many typical hypogene caves (Klimchouk, 2007) iron ore  
     caves are not evidently linked to rising ground water paths, and  
     thus there is no clear relationship between caves and ground wa- 
     ter routes. 

     It appears that the final morphology of iron ore caves is heav- 
     ily affected by surficial processes. Unlike hypogene caves, these  
     caves seem to become integrated with slope hydrological pro- 
     cesses, resulting in an amalgamation of once isolated chambers,             Figure 6. Plan view of a large cave in the Iron Quadrangle show- 
     the final morphology displaying a much more linear pattern that             ing smaller passages (marked with an “X”) connecting once iso- 
     parallels the slope.                                                        lated chambers (marked with a circle). 

     CONCLUSIONS 
                                                                                 water flow routes are common features, although iron ore caves

     ties to hypogene processes, in that it develops at depth, away              tings, in which an active hypogene cave will eventually become  
     from surficial processes. The morphology at plan scale resembles            detached from groundwater systems, the later evolution of iron

Earth tides are another source of Pex in confined systems. All ce- 
lestial bodies exert a natural force of attraction to other masses,  
known  as  gravity.  The  gravity  between  any  two  bodies  is  di- 
rectly proportional to the product of their masses and is inversely  
proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  them.  The  
gravity exerted by moon and sun over the earth is the primary  
reason of the earth and ocean tides. The effects of other celestial  
bodies on earth and sea tides are negligible. While both of the  
earth and ocean tides are the result of gravitational forcing of  
the moon and sun, they have different properties.  Sea tides are  
affected also by other factors like currents and bathymetry and,  
their range of fluctuation may reach about 16 m (O’reilly et al.,  
2005). Sea tides causes movement of huge water masses which,  
in turn, may result in a substantial ocean loading over the un- 
derlying geologic material. On the other hand, earth tide causes  
the elastic deformation of the lithosphere at periods of about 12  
hours and longer. Elastic deformation caused by earth tides is in  
the form of bulges and depressions with a magnitude of less than  
a meter (mostly around 0.3 m - 0.5 m).

        he Toca da Boa Vista and Barriguda caves are located in Northeastern Brazil. They occur in the Neoproterozoic carbonates  
        (limestones and dolomites) of the Salitre Formation, located at Irecê Basin. This set of rocks occurs within the São Francisco  
TCraton, a region that was not affected by the Brasiliano-Pan-African orogeny (Pedreira et al., 1987). The caves occur at a dis- 
tance of approximately 300 m apart and there is a possibility of a link between them, but so far this has not been proven. Toca da Boa  
Vista has about 108 km of mapped passages and is therefore the largest cave in South America. Toca da Barriguda is smaller and has  
about 32 km of mapped galleries. 

The architecture of the Toca da Boa Vista and Barriguda caves present both a 2D network and spongework type (Auler, 2009). The  
control of the conduits is related to faults, fractures and axial planes of antiforms. The general configuration of the caves seems to  
follow the Pacuí riverbed that has its channel located about 1km southeast. The origin of these hypogenic caves was first postulated  
by Auler & Smart (2004), who described some hypogenic features and reported a acid source (H2 S) coming from existing pyrite in  
carbonates to explain the corrosion and dissolution of carbonate rocks. Klimchouk (2009) wrote about the need to investigate deeper  
this issue. He drew attention to the apparent feeders presence coming from the lower aquifer as well as to the importance of determi- 
nation of the source of acidity, since the amount of pyrite present doesn’t seem to be significant for the origin and development of the  
caves by hypogenic speleogenesis. 

Although the origin and development of the caves are still under discussion, abundant hypogenic forms are present. Feeders, rising  
wall channels, half ceiling tubes, half wall tubes, ceiling cupolas, convection cupolas and wall niches are the major forms found. The  
linear geometry of caves suggests that they have a structural control. In addition, cavities generated at Toca da Boa Vista and Bar- 
riguda caves seem to follow the same stratigraphic level, as well as existing permeable structures such as fractures, faults and axial  
planes of antiforms. The process of ascending flow through these structures has resulted in the opening of the cavities by hypogenic  
dissolution as well as the collapse of blocks caused by the lack of sustainability of the layers generated by the voids left by the dis- 
solution. Outlets that would flow to levels above were not found. The origin and evolution of the cave system, however, needs further  
investigation.

             he present study investigates the lithofacies and processes such as karstification in the karst province of the Neoproterozoic  
             Una and Bambuí groups, located in the central-eastern part of Brazil. This province comprises several cave systems in carbon- 
     Tate rocks (Karmann and Sanchéz, 1979), which include the Toca da Boa Vista and Barriguda caves, considered the largest  
     hypogenic caves in South America (Auler and Smart, 2003). These caves were formed mainly in dolomites of the Salitre Formation,  
     which was deposited in a shallow marine environment in an epicontinental sea (Medeiros and Pereira, 1994). The Salitre Formation in  
     the cave area comprises laminated mud/wakestones, intraclatic grainstones, oncolitic grainstones, oolitic grainstones, microbial lami- 
     nites, colunar stromatolites, trombolites and fine siliciclastic rocks (marls, shales and siltites). A thin layer and nodules of chert also  
     occur, which sometimes are seen to fill faults and fractures. Phosphate deposits are also found. Our study focuses on cave mapping,  
     thin-section description, micro-tomography, isotopic analysis, and determination of petrophysical properties of different lithofacies.  
     Our preliminary data indicate several complex events of porosity increase and destruction, which led to the formation of the present  
     karts system.

          umerical models of speleogenesis typically simulate flow and dissolution within single fractures or networks of fractures.   
          Such models employ fracture flow and pipe flow equations to determine flow rates and only consider average velocities  
Nwithin each fracture segment.  Such approximations make large scale simulations of speleogenesis tractable.  However, they  
do not allow simulation of the formation and evolution of micro- or meso-scale cave passage morphologies.  Such morphologies are  
frequently studied within a field setting and utilized for the interpretation of the speleogenetic processes that formed the cave.  One  
classic example is the formation of scallops in cave streams with turbulent flow.  Scallops are used to interpret past flow velocities  
and directions.  However, a recent analysis of the theory of limestone dissolution in turbulent flow conditions suggests a discrepancy  
between theory and reality concerning the formation of limestone scallops (Covington, in review).  Similarly, the only attempt to  
numerically simulate flute formation in limestone found that the flute forms were not stable (Hammer et al., 2011).  Motivated by  
these puzzles, we are developing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework for the simulation of the evolution of dissolution  
morphologies. 

While this project was initially conceived to better understand dissolution in turbulent flow, the tools being developed are particu- 
larly well-suited to examine a variety of other questions related to cave morphology on the micro- and meso-scales.  There has been  
significant recent discussion about the interpretation of features that are diagnostic of hypogenic or transverse speleogenesis, such as  
the morphological suite of rising flow defined by Klimchouk (2007).  Other authors have suggested that such forms can be found in  
a variety of settings where confined flow is not present (Mylroie and Mylroie, 2009; Palmer, 2011).  We propose that simulation of  
such forms using a CFD speleogenesis code will allow a more complete understanding of the connections between process and form,  
because in such simulations the processes occurring are well-known, well-defined, and also can be adjusted within controlled numeri- 
cal experiments, where relevant parameters and boundary conditions are systematically varied. 

The CFD framework we are developing is based on the Lattice Boltzman method (Chen and Doolen, 1998), which is a popular tech- 
nique for modeling the mechanics of complex fluids, including fluid mixtures, reactive transport, porous media flow, and complex  
and evolving domain geometries. With this framework it is straightforward to simulate many of the processes occurring in hypogene  
settings, including complex fluid flows, dissolution, solute and heat transport, and buoyancy-driven flow.  Furthermore, this modeling  
framework allows these processes to be coupled so that their interactions and feedbacks can be explored.  With the suite of capabili- 
ties provided by this framework, we can begin to numerically simulate the processes occurring in hypogene speleogenesis, including  
the driving mechanisms and the role of buoyancy-driven flow and its relationship with the morphological suite of rising flow.  In the  
spirit of a workshop, this work is presented as in-progress, in the hopes that it will stimulate discussion on potential applications of  
the model being developed.

 INTRODUCTION 

Until recently, most limestone caves were believed to form by  
dissolution of rock by meteoric water that acquired its acidity  
by  surface-derived  CO2 . These  epigenic  caves  differ  from  the  
so-called hypogenic ones by the direction of the water flow, i.e.  
descending in the first and ascending in the second case (Klim- 
chouk, 2007, 2009) or by the origin of acidity, generated at depth  
for the latter (Palmer, 1991, 2011; Tisato et al., 2012). In more  
recent years, an increasing number of caves thought to be epi- 
genic in origin have revealed being caused by rising flows  or  
by waters that acquired their aggressivity at depth (Klimchouk,  
2007,  2009).  Sulfuric  acid  caves  are  the  most  interesting  and  
best studied among these.                                                      Figure 1. Location of the four described caves. 

Sulfuric acid caves have been known for a long time in Europe  
(e.g., Socquet, 1801; Hauer, 1885; Principi, 1931; Martel, 1935),  
but their detailed genesis was described in American caves much                SULFURIC ACID SPELEOGENESIS (SAS)

     often present in limestone sequences, can cause the formation of  
     sulfuric acid, speeding up the dissolution of the carbonate rock  
     (Tisato et al., 2012). The reaction of sulfuric acid with other min- 
     erals (e.g. clays) causes the formation of other sulfates such as  
     jarosite, alunite, basaluminite, etc. Some of these minerals, es - 
     pecially those containing potassium, can be dated with the K/Ar  
     and Ar/Ar methods (Polyak et al., 1998). Also gypsum can be  
     dated using the U/Th method (Sanna et al., 2012). The ages of  
     minerogenesis exactly corresponds to the age of cave formation,  
     when the SAS process was active. 

     Sulfuric acid caves are thus often intimately related to the con- 
     tact zone between the water level, from which H2 S rises, and the  
     air. Enlargement of the voids mainly happens by condensation- 
     corrosion  processes  in  a  highly  acidic  environment  (Audra  et  
     al., 2007). These processes are greatly enhanced in the presence  
     of thermal differences between the rising (thermal) waters and  
     the cave walls and atmosphere. Dissolution of carbonate rock in  
     these conditions is extremely fast compared to normal epigenic  
     caves and can cause the formation of sizeable cavities in prob- 
     ably only a few thousands of years.  

     MORPHOLOGY OF SULFURIC ACID  
     WATER TABLE CAVES 

     The most typical form of sulfuric acid cave is the water table  
     cave (Audra et al., 2009a, 2009b), with a more or less horizontal  
     development mimicking the former or still active level of the ris- 
     ing more or less thermal and acidic fluids. These H2 S containing  
     waters are discharged through deep fractures that are enlarged  
     in  the  oxidation  (vadose)  zone.  These  feeding  fissures  (Figs.  
     2A-C-D, 3A, and 4D) tend to close going downward, because  
     dissolution, and thus enlargement, is most efficient in the alti- 
                                                                                 Figure 2. Grotte du Chat: A. Corrosion table and discharge slot

     horizontal  cave  level  developing  along  the  fractures  through         of caves. The sulfide-rich waters can form pools or a sheet flow  
     which acidic fluids were discharged. This can result in a more              corroding the edges and the floor of the passages. This creates  
     or less elongated anastomotic cave passage with the discharging             the typical almost horizontal pavement of these caves (Figs. 2D,  
     slots along its path and right up to the blind end, or in maze caves        3A, and 4D), and corrosion notches with a flat roof carved by

     blocks located between these precursor fractures collapsed.  A  
     crawlway between boulders leads to a ledge at the top of the in- 
     clined (ca. 60°) lower chamber. Both the hanging- and footwall  
     in this chamber are coated with carbonate deposits, which reach  
     up to 125 cm in thickness.  

     Solution-smoothed walls — In the upper chamber, the walls are  
     coated with mammillary calcite, up to a height of ca. 2 m above  
     the chamber’s floor (ca. 23 m above the water table). The coating  
     is visibly thinned-out by corrosion, so that its initial thickness  
     cannot  be  determined.  The  limestone  walls  above  the  calcite  
     coating are also smoothed by dissolution (Fig. 3). 

     Flat channels along fractures and calcite veins — Small chan- 
     nels  with  characteristic  solution  morphology,  precluding  any  
     involvement of gravity-driven water flow, cut through both the  
     bedrock limestone and the old calcite veins on the eastern and  
     western walls of the upper chamber.  

     Cupolas in indurated alluvium-colluvium — In the ceiling of the  
     upper chamber, composed of carbonate-cemented alluvium-col- 
     luvium, dissolutional cupola are present. The solution surfaces  
     cut uniformly across massive limestone bedrock as well as al- 
     luvium-colluvium consisting of cobbles, finer-grained material,  
     and carbonate cement. The cupolas are locally separated by mil- 
     limeter-thin partitions.

     a layer of soft, powdery material, extending into the wall up to  
     2 cm and eventually grading into hard, unaltered limestone. De-             Figure 3. Solution-smoothed wall in the upper chamber of Devils

     be particularly important in thermal caves, where temperature                  in Jones et al. (in review).  
     differences facilitate air convection and water condensation, as  
     well as in sulphidic caves, where degassing and subsequent oxi- 
     dation of hydrogen sulphide (H2 S) gas provides a ready source  
     of acidity to the subaerial cave environment. 

     In pioneering studies on the formation of sulphidic caves, con- 
     densation corrosion via H2 S degassing and oxidation to sulph- 
     uric acid was considered the primary mechanism for speleogen- 
     esis (Principi, 1931; Egemeier, 1981). However, recent research  
     has cast doubt on the importance of subaerial H2 S oxidation for  
     sulphidic  cave  formation  (Engel  et  al.,  2004).  In  the  Frasassi  
     cave  system,  Italy,  morphological  evidence  for  both  subaerial  
     and  subaqueous  limestone  dissolution  has  been  extensively  
     documented (Galdenzi, 1990; Galdenzi and Maruoka, 2003). In  
     particular,  corrosion  above  the  water  table  has  resulted  in  the  
     formation of massive gypsum deposits as well as specific pas- 
     sage  morphologies.  Measured  rates  by  Galdenzi  et  al.  (1997)  
     corroborated morphological evidence that condensation corro- 
     sion  is  important  at  least  under  certain  conditions.  Therefore,  
     in  order  to  better  define  the  role  of  subaerial  processes  in  the  
     Frasassi  cave  system,  we  quantified  sulphide  flux  to  the  cave  
     atmosphere in the modern cave environment, and documented  
     morphological evidence for subaerial corrosion in the past.

     Jurassic Calcare Massicio Formation. The lowermost levels are

         he development of caves influenced by the deep circulation of water has received increasing interest for the last thirty years.  
         Presently, hypogene caves have been recognized all around the world. Conversely, the ancient examples filled with sediments  
 Tand representing palaeokarst forms are not so common. 

The karst forms and their sediment fillings were encountered in the Dębnik Anticline (Kraków region, Southern Poland) composed of  
Middle Devonian to Mississippian carbonates. The development of karst slightly postdates the Permian (ca. 300 Ma) volcanic activity  
in the Kraków region. In this region major transcontinental strike and slip Hamburg-Kraków-Dobruja fault zone induced a series of  
minor, en echelon, extensional faults, which served as magma passages and guided karst conduits. 

The karst forms in the Dębnik Anticline reach several to tens of meters in size. They are filled with: i) massive, subaqueous, coarse  
crystalline calcite spar; ii) crystalloclastic, bedded limestones; iii) jasper lenses; iv) kaolinitised tuffs. The sediments are characterized  
by red colouration caused by iron compounds. 

Coarse crystalline calcite spar composes beds up to several dozen centimeters in thickness. They are laminated and comprise frutexites  
type structures. The calcites are interbedded with pinkish-red crystalloclastic limestones, which are built of detritic calcite crystals  
from silt size to a few millimeters across. Some of the crystals are of skeletal type. Crystalloclastic limestones are normally graded.  
Both calcite spar and crystalloclastic limestones underwent synsedimentary deformations, which resulted in brecciation and plastic  
deformations. 

The above deposits fill karst forms up to a few metres in lateral extent. However, analogously filled enormously huge (up to around  
100 m across) forms were recognized in the early 80s of the last century. Presently, they are completely exploited.  

The karst forms were fragments of extensive circulation system. It was fed by waters of elevated temperature, rich in endogenic CO2,  
which is proved by fluid inclusion analysis and stable isotope investigation. The origin of this system was associated with volcanic  
activity. The roots of the system are represented by fissures filled with coarse crystalline, red and white calcites of onyx type, which  
are common in the Dębnik Anticline. Water issuing from this system on the surface caused precipitation of red travertines. These  
travertines are preserved only as clasts in the Lower Permian conglomerates deposited in the local tectonic depressions. 

The study was financed by Ministry of Science and Higher Education project N307 022 31/1746.

low phreatic caves occur in several areas, most notably in the  
Nature  Preserve  of  the  Hainholz/Beierstein  at  Düna/Osterode/ 
Lower Saxony. Here, we sampled all water bodies in May 1973  
and monitored 31 stations between Nov. 23rd, 1974, and April  
24th, 1976, with a total  933 samples, allowing us to characterize  
the provenance of these waters. These monitoring results were  
published only partially (PCO2 data, see Kempe, 1992). Here, I  
use the data set to show that the Jettenhöhle (the largest cave in  
the Hainholz) has been created by upward moving, carbonate- 
bearing, groundwater of high PCO2 . Even though the cave has  
now only small cave ponds and essentially is a dry cave above  
the ground water level, it is a hypogene cave because of the up- 
ward movement “of the cave-forming agent” (sensu Klimchouk,  
2012). Likewise, the Schlotten are created by water rising from  
the underlying carbonate aquifer, but under a deep phreatic set- 
ting. 

THE QUESTION 

Hypogene karstification can be defined in several ways (for a  
recent overview see Klimchouk, 2012). Central for it is that “the  
cave-forming agent” (Klimchouk, 2012, p.750) responsible for  
cave formation rises from below. In case of hypogene caves in  
evaporative rocks, the “agent” is the water itself. It rises from  
strata  below  the  karstifiable  rock  and  either  returns  there  or  
emerges as artesian water to the surface dissolving the evapo- 
rites (gypsum, anhydrite or salt) as it passes through. 

All this normally should occur below or even far below the lo- 
cal water table in the phreatic realm. But what if the majority of  
the cave volume formed is largely above the water table even                  Figure 1. Zechstein Basin (white area) underlaying Germany in  
though it is not fossil? This is the case for some of the German              large parts. The second largest area is occupied by the Keuper  
gypsum caves.                                                                 (Triassic) gypsum layer in Southern Germany (fragmented area

     the water will rise into the hanging Werra Anhydrite, dissolving

the Marthahöhle (Table 1) (Fig. 7), the Klinkerbrunnen and the  
Polenloch.  Other  caves  are  associated  with  sinkholes,  sinking

In May 1973, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft niedersächsische Höhlen  
(ArgeNH)  sampled  all  available  cave  ponds,  sinkhole  ponds,  
springs and creeks in the area (Fig. 5) (Brandt et al., 1975). This  
sampling provided data that allowed classifying the various karst  
water bodies. In continuation of this work, the ArgeNH sampled  
most of these sites on a biweekly basis (i.e., 35 series) between  
Nov. 23rd, 1974, and April 24th, 1976. Hydrochemical results  
of 933 samples of 31 stations were published by Kempe (1992)  
as part of his habilitation thesis. Data at the time were mostly  
evaluated for PCO  (CO  pressure), not so much for total ions

     Figure 8 plots sulfate versus alkalinity values that allows group- 
     ing  the  waters  according  to  their  provenience.  Lowest  sulfate  
     values but highest alkalinities are characteristic for springs from  
     carbonate karst. Spring 10 (called the “Arteser”, since it rises  
     from a 2 m deep natural well) has the lowest Saturation Index  
     of  gypsum  (SIgyp)  of  -1.825  ±  0.592,  N  =  19,  and  the  high- 
     est PCO2 (20,015 ± 9926ppm, N = 30). Its water rises from the  
     Staßfurt limestone (a formation called “Stinkschiefer” because  
     of the intense oily smell when broken) east of the Hainholz Fault  
     that down-thrusts the Hauptanhydrite to the west (see Fig. 5).  
     The spring of the “Bollerkopf Creek” delivers water from the  
     same strata and has similarly low sulfate (SIgyp -1.615 ± 0.471,  
     N=19) and high alkalinity values but because the collection site  
     was several hundred meters below the spring, the PCO2 is much  
     lower  (2512  ±  1807ppm  N  =  28)  than  in  the  “Arteser”.  Both  
     samples have very low total dissolved solids (TDS) (519 ± 151  
     and 511 ± 135 mg/l, respectively). 

     Highest  sulfate  and  lowest  alkalinity  values  are  displayed  by  
     seepage water collected in the Jettenhöhle (No 12), with a mean  
     SIgyp of -0.024 ± 0.046, N=11, and a TDS of 2120 ± 180 mg/l.  
     Associated shallow cave ponds St. 29 and 30 have SIgyp of - 
     0.082 ± 0.079, N = 7, and -0.105 ± 0.095, N = 7, and TDS values  
     of 1863 ± 478, N = 21, and 2039 ± 366 mg/l, N = 18, respective- 
     ly. Interestingly, the seepage water is very low in PCO2, i.e. 735  
     ± 497ppm, N = 21, showing that the water degassed largely dur- 
     ing dripping, while the seepage water pools show higher PCO2

     suggesting that these puddles are fed also by water films and not  
     only by freely dripping water.                                                     Figure 7. The Marthahöhle, the second largest caves of the Hain-

     relatively high alkalinities and large variations in concentrations,  
     and  those  that  represent  cave  ponds  and  sulfate-karst  springs  
     which have lower alkalinities and higher sulfate concentrations  
     and lower variations in concentrations (Fig. 8). 

     Figure 9 shows the interannual TDS variations of some of the  
     stations in comparison. As already stated, the “Arteser” (St. 10)  
     has  the  lowest  values  throughout  the  sampling  period.  More- 
     over it does not display any interannual trend. The highest values  
     are displayed by the seepage water of sample 12. Its record was  
     interrupted between end of August and end of December 1975  
     because of dry weather conditions. Afterwards, the TDS values  
     were lower, possibly because of rapid winter rains, percolating  
     fast through the cracks of the cave’s ceiling. The second highest  
     values belong to the “Jettenquelle,” a small spring (St. 19), op- 
     posite the entrance to the Jettenhöhle but most probably hydro- 
     logically not connected to it. Its average TDS amounted to 2020

Interesting is also that the concentrations of the four upper curves  
decreased towards the winter of 1975. The ceasing of the seep- 
age water suggests a dry period. Apparently, then the cave ponds  
received less seepage water causing a lowering in TDS because  
they contain a higher proportion of upwelling groundwater.                        with solution cups (Laugnäpfe) and sloping sidewalls (Facetten)

             he carbon dioxide produced in the soil and dissolved in the percolation water is considered as the main agent for karstification  
             in the carbonate rocks. Superficial morphologies and underground caves are product of the corrosion of the limestone, while  
     Tcarbonate speleothems is the other end member of the process.  

     Hypogene speleogenesis driven by deep seated fluids is the cave formation processes for the main karst systems in the Apennines of  
     Italy. Hydrogen sulfide and endogenic carbon dioxide are the main agents for underground karst corrosion and the soil carbon dioxide  
     plays a secondary rule. The limestone corrosion driven by hydrogen sulfide produces gypsum deposits in caves that could be assumed  
     as the indicator of the hypogene speleogenesis.  The action of endogenic carbon dioxide in the cave formation, especially if it operates  
     at lower temperature, is not easy to detect and the resulting cave morphology is not helpful to recognize the cave formation process. 

     The main sources of carbon dioxide in the underground karst system in the Apennines of Italy can be related to different processes  
     driven by the endogenic fluids emissions. The crustal regional degassing seems to be the prevalent source for carbon dioxide in the  
     karst massifs with the main release in the groundwater. Hydrogen sulfide and methane oxidation, possibly mediated by bacteria activ- 
     ity, are other sources in the buried Cenozoic sediments. Releasing of carbon dioxide along the faults and in the fractures occurring  
     in the carbonate rocks is an important source, especially in the seismically active area. Finally, thermogenic reactions with carbonate  
     rocks are well known as one of the main production mechanism of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere. 

     Data from carbon dioxide monitoring in several caves show a relevant contribution of the endogenic carbon dioxide (about 75 %) in  
     the karst system which drives the speleogenesis reactions and shapes the underground morphologies.

     morphology of this level indicates speleogenesis under phreatic  
     conditions.    Until  recently,  speleogenesis  activity  occurred  on  
     most of this level surface, but anthropogenic over-use of the re- 
     gional aquifer since mid 20th century lowered the water-table to  
     the point that this level has almost dried out. Consequently, the  
     “wetland” was reduced to a fraction of its original size. 

     The Ayyalon Cave has unique ecosystem. Lacking sunlight and  
     a constant supply of organic material, the ecosystem is based on  
     chemoautotrophic primary production, by Beggiatoa-like bacte- 
     ria that create a bacterial mat on the water surface. The isotopic  
     composition of carbon and oxygen in the fauna and the bacteria  
     shows that the latter are the energy source for the system. The  
     cave groundwater contains new species of eyeless, pigmentless  
     stygobitic  crustaceans.  Troglobitic  terrestrial  arthropods  were  
     found in the adjacent area within the cave. 

     The faunistic assemblage consists of six endemic stygobiont and  
     troglobiont  crustaceans  and  other  arthropods. Two  species  are  
     still under unclear status (Por et al., 2013).  Some species, such  
     as  the  scorpion Akrav  israchanani  apparently  became  extinct,  
     probably due to the massive drop of water level in the cave and  
     resulting reduction in primary production at the water surface.

        last three decades by observations that revealed cave passages unrelated to groundwater drainage routes and surface topogra- 
        phy. Most of these passages show unusual morphologies, such are cupolas, floor feeders (i.e., inlets for deep-seated fluids), and  
T 
huge irregular-shaped rooms that terminate abruptly, and often a rich and diverse mineral association. A hypogenetic speleogenetic  
pathway was proposed for this group of caves. 

The presence of abundant gypsum deposits in caves with one or more of the passage morphologies listed above, have prompted sci- 
entists to suggest a new theory (i.e., sulfuric acid speleogenesis, SAS) of cave development. In the hypogenic SAS model, the source  
of acidity is the sulfuric acid produced by oxidation of H2 S (originating from sulfate reduction or petroleum reservoirs) near or at the  
water table, where it dissolves the limestone bedrock and precipitates extensive gypsum deposits. SAS is now thoroughly documented  
from numerous caves around the world, with the best examples coming from the Guadalupe Mountains (NM), Frasassi caves (Italy),  
selected caves in France, Cueva de Villa Luz (Mexico), and Cerna Valley (SW Romania). 

To date, discrimination between epigene and hypogene speleogenetic pathways is made using cave morphology criteria, exotic min- 
eral assemblages, and the predominantly negative δ34S values for the cave sulfates. This presentation highlights the role sulfur and  

oxygen stable isotope analyses have in discriminating between epigene and hypogene caves. 

Based on a number of case studies in caves of the Cerna Valley (Romania), we found that relatively S-depleted isotopic composition of  
cave minerals alone does not provide enough information to clearly distinguish SAS from other complex speleogenetic pathways. In  
fact, δ34S values of SAS by-products depend not only on the source of the S, but also on the completeness of S redox reactions. There- 

fore, similar studies to this are needed to precisely diagnose SAS and to provide information on the S cycle in a given karst system. 

Integrating cave mineralogy, passage morphology, and geochemical studies may shed light on the interpretation of polygenetic caves,  
offering clues to processes, mechanisms, and parameters involved in their genesis (sulfate-dominated).

              ypogene or per-ascensum, whatever you prefer to call them, caves that form from the bottom up have a great range of patterns  
              in plan, large cavity morphology and an expanding, but specific suite of speleogens that distinguish them from fluvial caves  
     Hformed by descending surface water. Once thought to be rare and unusual, caves or sections of caves with plans, large cavities  
     and suites of “hypogene” speleogens are turning up in situations traditionally thought to have fluvial or even glacial origin. The role  
     of condensation corrosion in the formation of cavities and speleogens remains controversial, but surprisingly some insights may come  
     for processes in salt mines. Phantom rock formation and removal and similar processes involving removal of dolomitized bedrock,  
     de-dolomitized bedrock, and almost trace-free removal of palaeokarst raise problems of both temporal relationships and of how to  
     distinguish between the outcomes of recent and ancient processes. The presence of “hypogene” speleogens in both gneiss and marble  
     caves in Sri Lankan of unclear origin adds to the complexity. Back in the early 1990s, before hypogene caves were de-rigour, workers  
     such as David Lowe were puzzling about speleo-inception, how caves begin. Perhaps the rare occurrences of solution pockets in joints  
     in obvious fluvial caves, such as Postojna Jama, are indicating that many more caves than we imagine are actually multi-process and  
     multiphase and that “hypogene” processes of various types are significant agents of speleo-inception.

close to the recharge area, all samples have remarkable amount  
of  Helium-3,  which  has  been  released  from  mantle  (Fig.  3).   
Quantifying magnitude of mantle He-3 is difficult and for most  
cases is impossible because of the mixture of gases from vari- 
ous sources. He-3 content of groundwater along both transects  
reach maximum values just before the Obruk Plateau where the  
aquifer becomes unconfined. Beyond this point, gas composition  
of groundwater diluted by recharge from plateau and/or degas- 
sing of unconfined groundwater (Fig. 4).  Although, any R/Ra  
ratio greater than 1 is associated with mantle gas contribution,  
simultaneous  increase  in  He-4  content  also  indicates  presence  
of crustal He-4 production along the groundwater flow path of  
KCB. R/Ra values up to 4.77 have also been observed in thermal  
groundwater samples at the NE boundary of the KCB (Gülec et  
al., 2002). 

Almost all collapse dolines are located along the suture zone be- 
tween Anatolide-Tauride and Kirsehir Massif continental frag- 
ments (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). It seems that this suture zone provides  
a preferential route for heat and mass escape from mantle.  

Kirkgöz Karst Aquifer 

KKA is located at the SW part of the Taurus Mountains. KKA  
is drained mainly by the Kirkgöz group of springs whose mean  
annual discharge is 18.5 m3/sec. KKA’s spring zone is located  

along  the  foot  of  mountain  where  carbonate  rocks  with  well- 
developed karst overlain tectonically by impermeable ophiolitic  
rocks at elevation of about 300 m asl. Kirkgöz springs form a                   Figure 2. Location map of sampling sites and collapse dolines of

1996). None of the springs (with similar hydrogeologic setting                  in Turkey. This  high  R/Ra  ratio  apparently  indicates  heat  and  
and discharge rate) throughout the Taurus Mountain Range have                   mass transport from mantle to deep-seated fluids underneath the

             he origin of caves in the Black Hills has long been de- 
             bated. Their history is long and complex, involving early  
     Tdiagenesis, meteoric karst (now paleokarst), deep burial,  
     tectonic uplift, and, finally, enlargement of previous voids to the  
     caves of today. The final stage is usually the only one recognized  
     and is the topic of this paper. Genetic hypotheses include arte- 
     sian  flow,  rising  flow  (preferably  thermal),  diffuse  infiltration,  
     and mixing of various water sources. The last process best fits  
     the regional setting and water chemistry.  

     INTRODUCTION 

     The Black Hills were formed by Laramide uplift between 65 and  
     30 Ma. The central peaks consist of Precambrian igneous and  
     metamorphic rock, and the truncated edges of  overlying sedi- 
     mentary strata dip off to the sides, forming concentric ridges and  
     valleys around the central mountains. Caves are located in the  
     Madison Formation (limestone and dolomite) of early Carbon- 
     iferous age (Mississippian in North America). The largest caves  
     (Wind and Jewel) are dense fissure networks with several levels  
     concordant to the strata, which locally dip about 5 degrees away  
     from the central uplift.  

     Their main (final) phase of cave origin has long been debated.  
     Most of the accepted hypotheses involve hypogene processes.  
     They have been attributed by various researchers to (a) artesian  
     flow, (b) rising water, probably thermal, (c) enlargement of relict           Figure 1. Plan view and simplified geologic profile of Wind Cave,

     paleokarst, (d) diffuse recharge through the basal sandstone of  
     the overlying Minnelusa Formation, and (e) mixing of two or  
     more  water  sources.  Each  model  is  examined  below  vs.  local           but instead simply stop or become very narrow. The caves con-

     cave morphology, geology, hydrology, and geochemistry. There  
                                                                                   pression of being entirely phreatic, with many domed ceilings

     The caves occupy only the upper 100-150 m of the limestone.                   is reached in only a few places in Wind Cave, with no hint that  
     They are located only beneath the thin up-dip edge of the Min-                the caves continue to depth. Jewel Cave does not reach the water

     of the Minnelusa the caves become very sparse and disappear a                 downward. (See Sando, 1988, for a regional description of this  
     short distance away. They are also very sparse beneath incised                paleokarst.) The only direction in which they seem unlimited is  
     valleys that have cut through the Minnelusa into the limestone.               along the strike of the beds. The caves are essentially “floating”  
     Passages beneath the limestone do not terminate in breakdown,                 in the Madison, with almost no contact with boundaries.

     larged these voids to form the present cave. 

     Diffuse Infiltration 

     Diffuse  recharge  through  the  basal  Minnelusa  Formation  is  
     mildly attractive because many network mazes in other regions  
     cluster beneath thin sandstone caps. However, the caves reach  
     the sandstone/ limestone contact in only a few places, and the  
     upper levels that do reach the contact are sparse irregular rooms,  
     rather than fissure networks. Still, there is some recent support  
     for this idea: Michael Wiles (Jewel Cave, personal communica- 
     tion, 2013) envisions water passing laterally through the Minn- 
     elusa, with local loops down into the Madison and then back up  
     again. It is difficult to envision a distribution of hydraulic head  
     that would achieve this flow pattern. 

     Mixing Processes 

     Mixing of two or more water sources of contrasting chemistry  
     applies to seacoast aquifers, but does it also apply in the Black  
     Hills?  The  model  of  Bögli  (1964)  and  other  authors  is  perti- 
     nent here, where two waters of contrasting CO2 content mix to  
     produce  an  undersaturated  solution.  Consider  diffuse  recharge  
     through the thin sandstone base of the Minnelusa combined with  
     recharge from the outcrop area. Both are active today, but nei- 
     ther contributes significantly to cave enlargement. Most of this  
     paper deals with this model because it seems valid and yet is so  
     seldom discussed. If these two sources were able to mix before  
     the water table dropped, they could have produced the cave in                     Figure 3. Intense corrosion by seepage of low-PCO  water into

pools  water.  (All  analyses  calculated  from  measurements  of  
water chemistry in Back 2011 and Long et al., 2012.) Clearly,  
before the pH was measured, the diffuse infiltration water had  
gained CO2 from the cave air, and the water from the outcrop had  
lost CO2 to the cave air by degassing. 

Mixing  of  these  two  waters  would  produce  a  solution  under- 
saturated with calcite. Undersaturation would have been much  
greater  if  these  waters  had  entered  a  water-filled  cave  where  
degassing into the atmosphere could not take place. If it were  
possible to measure the initial water sources (described above  
Figures 3 and 4), the amount of undersaturation would be about  
twice as great. The cave would be concentrated in the mixing  
zone and could not extend very far down-dip because the solu- 
tional aggressiveness would have been largely exhausted – as in  
mixing-zone caves in seacoast aquifers today.  

Most of the present infiltrating water corrodes the cave ceiling,  
but it has little chance to mix with inflowing water from the lime- 
stone outcrop areas, as it did when the caves were presumably  
filled with water. Also, the water supply appears to be much less  
today than when the caves were actively enlarging, as shown by  
the large paleo-valleys up-slope from the caves. 

Measurement of infiltration rate through the Minnelusa cap has  
been  measured  at  both  caves  by  Wiles  (1992).  They  indicate

hypogene byproducts from vadose speleothems in some regions.   
Some minerals in the assemblage listed in Table 1 and associated  
with hypogene caves, have yet to be studied in detail.  Figure  
2 shows a few of the less common minerals.  Each will have  
isotopic systems that will undoubtedly contribute more proxies.   
Mn- and Fe-oxides are more common (Figs. 3 and 4), and hold  
the same potential.  Some Mn- and Fe-oxides are dateable by  
(U-Th)/He and Ar-Ar methods (Shuster et al., 2005).   

Thus far, these tools are telling us that the sources of solutions  
and gases coming from depth and mixing with aquifer ground- 
waters to create hypogene speleogenesis in the western United  
States  are  related  to  volcanism/tectonism  since  the  Laramide  
orogeny (with a few examples of older events).  These caves and  
deposits  have  been  formed  in  the  Basin  and  Range  provinces  
from Nevada to Texas and northern Mexico; in the Rio Grande  
Rift  province  in  southern  New  Mexico  and  northern  Mexico  
(Hill, 1987; Lueth et al., 2005); along the margins of the Colo- 
rado Plateau in Grand Canyon, Arizona, and Glenwood Canyon,  
Colorado; in the Black Hills of South Dakota; and in the Rocky  
Mountain provinces (Luiszer, 1996).  The timing of mammillary  
formation in Grand Canyon seems to coincide with important  
volcanic or tectonic events.  The idea is that volcanic events can  
serve as “pumps” that force these hypogene solutions and gases  
upward (increase deep circulation); and that episodes of faulting  
open up joints that allow these deep solutions to move upward.   
Mantle processes are probably the drivers of the volcanic and  
tectonic activity.

                          DEVILS HOLE: ANTIKARST IN THE MOJAVE

        he “classic” view of thermal hypogene caves is that rising (artesian?) warm waters become aggressive  as they cool, dissolving  
         carbonate to produce 3D caves with particular morphologies, such as mazes, spongework, and upward-pointing dissolution  
        morphs.  Devils Hole, Nevada, is a cave where rising 33-34°C waters precipitate thick coatings of mammillary (phreatic) cal- 
T 
cite on the walls of a simple planar (2D), nearly vertical fissure.  Why the difference? 

To understand Devils Hole’s contrary behavior, we need a basic understanding of the Ash Meadows groundwater flow system that  
feeds Devils Hole and the adjacent Ash Meadows spring line.  The Ash Meadows flow system (which underlies a land area of at least  
            2) is a sub-basin of the Death Valley regional flow system, which drains a huge area of the southern Great Basin to the ul- 
12,000 km 
timate sink in North America, Death Valley.  Climatically, the area of the Ash Meadows flow system is Mojave Desert, with average  
annual precipitation of 10 cm or less on the basin floors (<1000 m elevation), and possibly as much as 1 m at the highest elevations  
(roughly 3,600 m elevation) of the Spring Range west of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The geology of the Ash Meadows flow system is varied,  
but is dominated by thick (averaging ~4,600 m) deposits of Paleozoic marine carbonate rocks, which, in places, extend from the basal  
aquitard to the ridge tops, are widely exposed at the surface, and underlie more recent alluvial and volcanic deposits in other areas.   
The carbonate rocks are contiguous throughout much of the area of the flow system; given their brittleness and long history of tectonic  
deformation (up to and including modern Basin and Range extension), they host extensive networks of interconnected open fractures.   
The fracture networks act as integrated highly transmissive conduit systems that transport predominantly high-elevation recharge to  
basin-floor discharge points.  At the Ash Meadows flow system’s downstream end, the fracture-flow network is faulted up against a  
poorly transmissive aquitard, which causes the groundwater to well to the surface and discharge as the 16-km-long Ash Meadows  
spring line along the eastern flank of the Amargosa Desert. 

For the purposes of this discussion, the geneology of the Ash Meadows flow system can be divided into three parts.  The recharge  
areas are classic epigene karst where infiltrating precipitation becomes aggressive as it dissolves CO2 in the thin soil zone, and then  
dissolves carbonate bedrock deeper underground.  Given the present desert climate, epigene karstification is poorly developed.  As  
the water infiltrates deeper, it eventually recharges the aquifer and circulates through the fracture network to at least 1 km below land  
surface; in this part of the flow system, flow is more lateral than vertical and the regime could reasonably be called tectonogene, i.e.  
the primary volume generator is the continuing opening of conduits by tectonic extension.  Hence, speleogenesis at depth is hypogene  
in the dictionary sense – that is, formed/generated/born at depth below land surface.  This use of hypogene is at odds with the “classic”  
use of that term, so tectonogene may be a better descriptor, and does not conflict with any other conventional usage.  The lateral-flow  
tectonogene part of the flow system continues until groundwater flow approaches the aquitard barrier, at which point the water rises to  
discharge along the Ash Meadows spring line.  The water level in Devils Hole, though about 50 m above the spring pool elevations in  
Ash Meadows is about 17 m below the land surface, making Devils Hole, in effect, a tectonic cenote.  The configuration of the rising  
part of the aquifer beneath Devils Hole hydrologically resembles “classic” thermal hypogene regimes in that it is inundated by warm  
water rising from depth.   

However, the morphology of Devils Hole to ~150m below the water table is very different than classic thermal hypogene morpholo- 
gies.  The Devils Hole fissure is an open nearly vertical 2D fault plane; the water in it, instead of becoming aggressive as it rises and  
cools, becomes slightly supersaturated with respect to calcite, turning the rising limb into an antikarstic regime (i.e. a regime where  
rock precipitation is a primary geomorphic process) that precipitates mammillary calcite on all phreatic surfaces -- and has done so for  
at least a half a million years!  How can that be??? 

The answer seems to be that even though the PCO2 of the deep Ash Meadows flow system water is sufficiently high (roughly 10-2  
atm) for the water to become aggressive (undersaturated) on cooling, it apparently rises sufficiently rapidly that saturation decrease  
due to cooling is more than compensated by saturation increases resulting from pressure release: water saturated wrt calcite at 1 km  
depth becomes oversaturated by about 58 μmoles per kilogram when it is lifted to surface pressure at constant temperature.  That  
parcel of water would have to cool by more than 7 °C, to compensate for the pressure-release-derived supersaturation. 

Given that the PCO2 of Devils Hole water is about 40 times atmospheric, it might be argued that supersaturation in Devils Hole water  
is abetted by, or even primarily caused by, outgassing.  The presence of modern-day rafts and folia in Devils Hole unambiguously  
shows that CO2 outgassing from the water surface can stimulate rapid carbonate precipitation, but there are several reasons for be-

     lieving that outgassing is not necessarily the primary, or even a significant contributor to mammillary (phreatic) calcite precipitation.   
     First, unlike some cave pools where CO  outgassing has been interpreted as fostering precipitation of a carbonate girdle around the  
                                                      2 

     pool shallows, there is no precipitation on the deeper bare bedrock surfaces below the girdle.  The mammillary coating on the un- 
     derwater surfaces in Devils Hole extends to at least 150 m below the water table, and its thickness does not noticeably diminish with  
     depth or lateral distance from the entrance.  Second, there has not always been a Devils Hole.  Prior to a flow conduit stoping to the  
     surface to form Devils Hole, it was roofed over with bedrock.  The pre-collapse semi-closed system would have restricted CO2 outgas- 
     sing relative to today’s configuration, presumably with similar reductions in the component of mammillary precipitation attributable  
     to outgassing.  Third, mamillary precipitation tends to coat all phreatic surfaces with a uniformly thick layer of calcite, progressively  
     filling and sealing all cracks and holes, with the effect of further reducing the escape of CO2 and hence outgassing-driven speleothem  
     precipitation. In fact, given enough time, mammillary precipitation would eventually fill and plug the conduits comprising the dis- 
     charge end of the aquifer, driving the discharge area up-gradient.  A 10-m-wide mammillary vein exposed at land surface in eastern  
     Nevada, shows that, given enough time, mammillary calcite will fill even broad fissures.  On the other hand, in the Ash Meadows flow  
     system, the tendency for conduits to be sealed and filled with mammillary calcite is offset by ongoing fissure widening, which adds  
     volume faster than mammillary calcite can fill it.  A consequence of this is that the mammillary seals are broken with each bout of  
     extension, presumably allowing a new burst of CO2 outgassing that is progressively throttled back by continuing mammillary over- 
     growth and sealing, until the next time the conduit widens a bit more, and the cycle repeats.  That mammillary precipitation occurs in  
     the absence of outgassing is suggested by the presence of numerous calcite veins in cemented fanglomerate cliffs above Furnace Creek  
     Wash, a tributary to Death Valley from the east.  At least one of the calcite veins (as mammillary-lined or -filled fractures too narrow  
     to enter are traditionally called) is easily traceable tens of meters up the cliff face. Near the top, the vein expands into a big carbonate  
     mound – a fossil spring mound.  In desert environments, spring mounds are hot beds of biological activity that, like soils, tend to be  
     zones of high PCO2 .  Hence, calcite precipitation in the vein that fed the fossil spring mound is unlikely to have been augmented by  
     outgassing. 

     So there you have it; the Devils Hole antikarst rises to the challenge of showing that there is more than one way to be hypogene.

THE SALAFOSSA PALEOKARST SYSTEM 

The Salafossa mine is a well-studied example of mineralized pa- 
leokarst of Triassic age, always ascribed to an exposure event  
(Cros and Lagny, 1969; Lagny, 1969; 1974; 1975), exploited as  
a Zn-Pb-Ba-Fe deposit until 1986. 

The  ore  body,  that  correspond  to  the  paleokarst  infilling,  has   
an  approximate  size  of  700×200×100  m  and  is  hosted  within  
the Contrin Formation of Anisian age, also outcropping on the  
Latemar massif, overlain by the Sciliar Formation of Anisian- 
Ladinian age.

     SPELEOGENESIS BY THE SULFIDIC SPRINGS AT NORTHERN

                                                     WATER CHEMISTRY

         onspicuous  brackish  sulfidic  springs  have  been  described  at  the  northern  Sierra  the  Chiapas,  Mexico.  These  springs  are  
         produced by a mixture between regional and local groundwater flow paths. The regional groundwater has an average Total  
         Dissolved Ions of 3081 mg/L so it has a brackish composition. This brackish water is saturated with respect to calcite and  
C 
dolomite but undersaturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite and halite. The mass balance and the discharge rate are used to quantify  
the mass and volume of minerals that are dissolved by the brackish spring water following Appelo and Postma (1993). This quantifica- 
tion will allow comparing the various speleogenetic mechanisms in the area. This is considering the composition of the spring water is  
relatively constant over time, as it is suggested by periodic measurements at the Cueva de Villa Luz springs during the last 10 years. 

Sulfur isotopes in the water are consistent with anhydrite dissolution as the main source of the sulfate to the brackish spring water.  
Thus, the average 6 mol/L of sulfate in the brackish springs are produced by dissolution of 6 mol of anhydrite after subtracting the  
sulfate that could result from evapotranspiration of rainwater. Each liter of brackish water dissolved an average of 882 mg of anhy- 
drite, which are equivalent to dissolving 0.36 cm3                                                                3 
                                                         of this mineral considering a density of 2.981 g/cm . Additionally, using the average  
brackish water discharge rate of 144 L/s, an average of 57 g of anhydrite are being dissolved each second per every liter of brackish  
water. This is a minimal value because some of the sulfate in the water is used by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the subsurface to produce  
the hydrogen sulfide in the spring water. The anhydrite subject to dissolution is found interbedded in the Cretaceous carbonates, either  
from the subsurface at 4,000 m below sea level to the carbonate outcrops. 

Similarly, we can calculate the volume of halite that is being dissolved by the brackish springs, considering chloride is a conserva- 
tive element and subtracting the chloride concentration from the rainwater from that of the spring water following Appelo & Postma  
(1993). The 22 mol/L of chloride in the brackish water can result from dissolution in the subsurface of 22 moles or 1.3 g of halite per  
liter of brackish water. This mass of halite dissolved is equal to 0.59 cm3                                                 3 
                                                                                   considering a density of 2.168 g/cm . Alternatively, 118 g of  
halite are dissolved per second per each liter of brackish water if we use the average discharge rate of 144 L/s. 

Even when the brackish springs are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite, their dissolution is still possible due to the com- 
mon ion-effect of calcium after anhydrite dissolution and by mixing of waters with different compositions. A range of 10 to 80 % of  
brackish water from the regional aquifers mixes with fresh water from the local aquifer based on their water chemistry. Additionally,  
sulfuric acid speleogenesis occurs due to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid. 

Finally, the increase in the chloride concentration of the fresh water springs with respect to the concentration in rainwater was used to  
estimate that from the 4000 mm/y of annual precipitation, only 4%, 158 to 182 mm/y, recharge the aquifers. This low percentage is  
slightly higher than the 3.3% recharge in marls, marly limestone, silts and clays (Sanz et al., 2011), probably because of the relatively  
small area of carbonate outcrops over the entire region and the lack of recharge in altitudes higher than 1500 m above sea level.  

Sulfuric acid is the most obvious speleogenetic mechanism occurring in the caves of the northern Sierra de Chiapas, Mexico due to  
the high hydrogen sulfide concentration in the spring water. In addition, the location of the springs at a zone of regional and local  
discharge where waters from different composition converge and mix, and the amount of mixing calculated suggests mixing is also an  
important speleogenetic mechanism. However, the depth and the time constrains at which these two hypogenic mechanisms occur is  
still unknown. The relatively low rainwater recharge rate suggests epigenesis is limited. Most likely, the porosity created by dissolu- 
tion of anhydrite and halite in the subsurface is occluded by the precipitation of calcite. Chemical modeling and petrography will help  
to elucidate the order of the reactions occurring in the subsurface.

      PONDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBAERIAL CORROSION AS  
                                            A SPELEOGENETIC AGENT 

                                                             Ira D. Sasowsky1 

            ubaerial corrosion has been recognized as an important cave modifying process in limited settings.  But is it possible that we  
            overlook its importance in other cases?  Could it actually be a significant speleogenetic agent in its own right?  Numerous  
            corroding agents have been identified including sulfuric acid, carbonic acid, ambient water vapor, and thermal water vapor.   
      S 
     Morphogenetic features have been described, and cautions issued about possible confusion with hypogene features.  Theoretical  
     calculations seem to limit the importance of corrosion in many settings, but it appears that great care must be taken, especially for  
     possible confusion between “hypogene” morphologies in a cave. 

     Some caves in the Iberian Range (Spain) seem undoubtedly hypogene in origin based on hydrologic constraints.  They also contain  
     morphologies that are consistent with this origin.  But, extreme corrosion of speleothems and bedrock may be masking the nature of  
     the cave morphology post-drainage of the forming waters.  Topographic position of some caves suggests the possibility of a strong  
     component of subaerial corrosion as the cave forming agent.

    FINGERPRINTING WATER-ROCK INTERACTION IN HYPOGENE  
               SPELEOGENESIS: POTENTIAL AND LIMITATIONS OF  
                                          ISOTOPIC DEPTH-PROFILING 

                                                                      1                                 1

          issolution processes in karst regions commonly involve (meteoric) water whose stable isotopic (O, H, C) composition is dis- 
          tinctly different from that of the paleowaters from which the host rock (limestone, dolostone) formed. This, in theory, should  
Dlead to isotopic alteration of the host rock beyond the active solution surface as the modern karst water is out of isotopic  
equilibrium with the carbonate rock. No such alteration has been reported, however, in epigenetic karst systems. In contrast, isotopic  
alteration, commonly referred to as isotopic halos or fronts, are known from various hypogene systems (ore deposits, active hydro- 
thermal systems, etc.). These empirical observations suggest that stable isotope data may be a diagnostic tool to identify hypogene  
water-rock interactions particularly in cave systems whose origin is ambiguous. 

We have been testing the applicability of this assumption to karst settings by studying the isotopic composition of carbonate host rocks  
in a variety of caves showing clear-cut hypogene morphologies. Cores drilled into the walls of cave chambers and galleries were stud- 
ied petrographically and the C and O isotope composition was analyzed along these cores, which typically reached a depth of 0.5 to  
1.2 m. We identified three scenarios: (a) no isotopic alteration, (b) a sigmoidal isotope front within a few centimeters of the cave wall,  
and (c) pervasive isotope alteration throughout the entire core length. Type (a) was found in caves where the rate of cave wall retreat  
apparently outpaced the rate of isotopic alteration of the wall rock (which is typical, for example, for sulfuric acid speleogenesis). Type  
(c) was observed in geologically young, porous limestone showing evidence of alteration zones up to 5 m wide. The intermediate type  
(b) was identified in hypogene karst cavities developed in tight limestone, dolostone and marble.  

Our data in conjunction with evidence from speleothems and their geochemical and fluid-inclusion composition suggest that the spa- 
tial extent of the isotopic alteration front depends on the porosity and permeability, as well as on the saturation state of the water. Wider  
alteration zones primarily reflect a higher permeability. Shifts are most distinct for oxygen isotopes and less so for carbon, whereby  
the amplitude depends on a number of variables, including the isotopic composition of unaltered host rock, the isotopic composition  
of the paleofluid, the temperature, the water/rock ratio, the surface of water-rock contact, the permeability of the rock, and the time  
available for isotope exchange. If the other parameters can be reasonably constrained, then semi-quantitative temperature estimates of  
the paleowater can be obtained assuming isotopic equilibrium conditions. 

If preserved (scenarios b and c), alteration fronts are a strong evidence of hypogene speleogenesis, and, in conjunction with hypogene  
precipitates, allow to fingerprint the isotopic and physical parameters of the altering paleofluid. The reverse conclusion is not valid,  
however; i.e. the lack of evidence of isotopic alteration of the cave wall rock cannot be used to rule out hypogene paleo-water-rock  
interaction.
