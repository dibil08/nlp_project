Andrej Kranjc & Hong Liu: Lunanski »Shilin« (Kamniti gozd), vpliv ~loveka in varstvo (morebitnega) 
objekta svetovne naravne dedi{~ine (Yunnan, Kitajska) 

Kitajski izraz »shilin« (kamniti gozd) prehaja v mednarodno kra{ko terminologijo in pomeni »mega {krap- 
lje«, »gozd« mo~no razjedenih in korodiranih apnen~evih stebrov. Najbolj znan je Shilin pri mestu Lunan. 
Prvi znani zapisi o njem so iz 1382. Shilin je zelo pomembna turisti~na to~ka. Z razvijanjem modernega 
turizma so pri~eli 1980 in 1999 je obisk presegel 2 milijona turistov. 1981 je bilo celotno podro~je (350 km2) 

zavarovano.  Pod  okriljem  »National  Ministry  of  Construction«  zbirajo  gradivo  za  vpis  Shilina  v  seznam 
svetovne naravne dedi{~ine pri UNESCO. Vpliv ~loveka se kaæe predvsem v izkori{~anju (destrukciji) kam- 
nitih stebrov kot viru surovine, v pritisku prebivalstva na za{~iteno cono zaradi njihovega nara{~anja (potreba 
po novih gradbenih parcelah), v kmetijski (poljedelstvo in æivinoreja) dejavnosti, povezani z erozijo prsti in 
onesnaæevanjem podzemeljske vode (uporaba umetnih gnojil) ter zaradi hitrega nara{~anje {tevila obiskoval- 
cev. Za varstvo so povzeli vrsto ukrepov: prepoved izkori{~anja kamna v za{~itenem podro~ju (usmerjanje k 
pogozdovanju), gradnja turisti~nih naprav izven oæjega obmo~ja (in odstranitev takih naprav iz tega obmo~- 
ja), ustanovitev posebnega oddelka za varovanje (18 oseb) v okviru uprave Shilina, pridobitev visokih in 
spo{tovanih oseb posameznih naselij za »posebne ~uvaje« - prostovoljne sodelavce uprave Shilina.

Andrej Kranjc & Hong Liu: Lunan  »Shilin« (Stone Forest), human impact and protection of (even- 
tual) World Heritage Site (Yunnan, China) 

The Chinese expression »Shilin« (stone forest) is becoming an international term meaning megakarren, that 
is a »forest« of intensively corroded limestone pinnacles. The best known is Shilin near the town of Lunan. 
The first known description of Shilin is from 1382. Shilin is very important tourist site. Modern tourism be- 
gan to develop in 1980, in 1999 the number of visitors reached over 2 million. In 1981 the whole area (350 sq. 
km) was protected. Under the auspices of the National Ministry of Construction material is being collected 
for an application to inscribe Shilin into the list of World’s Natural Heritage at UNESCO. Related to human 
impact the most important threats are: exploitation (destruction) of limestone pinnacles as a source of rock 
material; the pressure of population towards the protection zone due to their increase (need for new building 
plots); agriculture (farming and stockbreeding) connected to soil erosion and underground water pollution 
(use of fertilisers); fast growth of visitor numbers. The Shilin administration introduced different protection 
measures: ban on rock (limestone pinnacles) exploitation in the protection zone (orientation towards affore- 
station); construction of new tourist facilities out of the core zone (and demolition of some of them in that 
zone); establishment of a special protection department within Shilin management (18 person); education of 
»special voluntary rangers« - recruited among highly respected persons of villages and towns in the region. 
Key words: karst geomorphology, human impact, megakarren, shilin, Lunan, Yunnan, China.

     The Chinese expression “shilin” (shi = stone, lin = forest                    ) is slowly becoming an 
international  term  meaning  a  kind  of  “megakarren”,  that  is  a  “forest”  of  intensively  corroded 
limestone pinnacles up to some ten meters high. Yuan (1988) defined it as: “a complex landscape 
consisting  of  dense  rock  spires  having  a  variety  of  shapes  separated  by  numerous  dissolution 
widened fractures. The surfaces of the spires and walls of the grikes exhibit vertical flutes (kar- 
ren).  The  spires  are  commonly  about  20  m  high  although  the  highest  reach  50  m.  The  upper 
surfaces of the spires are modified by dissolution by rain water.” According to Waltham (1997) 
there are two types of pinnacle karst, so-called “pinnacle (normal) karst” and “shilin” or “stone 
forest karst”. While the first one is typical of steep slopes of high limestone mountains, the se- 
cond one developed on single beds of gently dipping, solid limestone on the levelled top plateaux 
of southern China. The Dictionary of Modern Geography (Zu 1990) defined shilin as a special 
kind  of  high  stone  teeth  with  vertical  solutional  troughs  paralleling  the  vertical  rock  surface, 
where columns commonly 20 m high, even 50 m high, were formed by the water within the loose 
sediments (Song & Li 1997). 
     The best and the first known (in literature) shilin is that one near the town of Lunan (Fig. 1, 
2). But there are several shilins round Lunan and they can be found not only in Yunnan but also in 
the other provinces of China, as Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan shilins are known (altoget- 
her they cover about 900 km2) (Fig. 3). In the karstological literature in Central Europe the term 

“Steinwald” (i.e. stone forest in German language) is mentioned in Denes Balazs’s report of his 
visit to Karst in China in the years 1958 and 1959. He included pictures of a natural bridge in 
Lunan  (Tienschengtschiao),  map  of  the  Zhiyun  Cave  and  he  writes  about  “the  world  famous 
Schiling  (Steinwald)  in  Lunan  County  (Balazs  1960).  The  first  detailed  description  of  Lunan 
Shilin in Slovene karstological literature was written by Habi~ (1980). 
     Later,  due  to  the  bilateral  projects  between  Yunnan  Geographical  Institute  and  Karst  Re- 
search Institute, Postojna more reports on this and other shilins have been published in Slovene 
karst literature ([ebela 1996; Knez 1997; Zupan Hajna 1997; Chen et al. 1998). From some other 
karst  landscapes  in  the  world  features  similar  to  shilin  (or  sometimes  even  the  same  as  shilin) 
were  described.  At  some  places  we  can  speak  about  a  real  shilin;  some  described  features  are 
similar but different and have different names (i.e.. tsingy in Madagascar, Salomon 1997). More 
and  more  as  we  are  acquainted  with  karst  regions  of  the  world,  more  examples  of  pinnacle  or 
similar karst features are known. There are examples from America (Sierra de San Luis Potosi, 
Mexico,  Sierra  de  los  Organos,  Cuba),  Africa  (Kouilou  near  Mombassa),  and  Asia  (Mulu  in 
Sarawak, Mt. Kaijende in Papua New Guinea) (Ford et al. 1997). In Europe the most often cited 
are  Montpellier-le-Vieux,  France  (“relief  ruiniforme”  in  dolomites),  Ciudad  Encantada  (Fig.  4) 
and El Torcal (Fig. 5) in Spain, and “rocks” (more the result of erosion in different rocks) in the 
Polish Jura Mountains (Fig. 6). These are similar features in appearance but in origin and evolu- 
tion are different. So we fully agree with the statement of H. Trimmel (1997), that “the term stone 
forest should be restricted to the classical sites within southern China”. 
     The  best  known  and  we  can  say  classical  shilin  is  Shilin  near  the  town  of  Lunan  (former 
“xian” - county of Lunan, now Shilin), 90 km SE from the Yunnan capital Kunming, designating 
                                                                         
the geographical name. Its geographical position is 24° 30’ N and 103° 20’ E, at 1750 m above 
sea level. Mean temperature is 16.3° C with 936 mm of precipitation per year (Zhang 1984). This 
shilin is the best known and usually when referring to “shilin” one thinks of Lunan’s Shilin. The

word shilin was first written down by the ancient great Chinese poet Qu Yuan (about 340 - 278 
BC) in his poem “Ask Heaven” (Pan & Ji 1997). The well known description of Shilin is from 
 1382 (Wang et al. 1994). According to Lu Lian Zhou Zhi (1573-1619) there was a temple on a 
karst hill nearby the “HEMO” station of Naigu Shilin ancient paths, which had become the site of 
Buddha worship for the local people. Man began to excavate the Ziyun Cave in 1614 and placed 
a  stele  at  the  entrance.  In  this  period  also  the  tourist  path  was  constructed  round  Shilin  (Song 
 1995). Xi Xiake (1586 - 1641), famous geographer and karst researcher, travelled to Yunnan in 
 1638. Because his “Yunnan Travel Diary I” is lost, it is impossible to recognise his route and his 
impressions in detail. From the remnants of his travel notes it is possible to presume that Xi Xiake 
visited Shilin. The great philosopher and scholar Gu Yanwu (1613-1682) gave the first convin- 
cing description of Shilin. This period can be called the early discovery phase.

     The second phase can be called early tourism development phase during which exploitation, 
protection  and  scientific  research  have  developed.  In  1931,  the  chairman  of  Yunnan  Province, 
Yun Long visited Dadeishui waterfall with the government officials and his family and enjoyed 
the  Shilin  landscape  on  the  way  home.  He  wrote  “Shilin”  to  describe  the  unique  and  magical 
stone forest landscape. He set up a special fund for pavilions, paths and villa construction there, 
and appointed regional staff to manage them. These were the earliest tourism facilities in Shilin 
scenic  area.  In  the  30’s  of  the  twentieth  century,  Beijing  University,  Qinghua  University  and 
Nankai University moved to Kunming due to the war against Japan; there many scholars have 
made the research of Yi nationality culture in this area and also of Shilin (Ma 1936) (Fig. 7). In 
1944, the provincial government set aside a sum of money to build a villa, and assigned a full- 
time officer and 20 staff to manage house property and afforestation. At that time, Shilin was yet 
not opened to the public. The visitors are all government officials and rich men, the sightseers 
were few, but have left many art works of carved stone behind. The Shilin management office

was set up in 1951 under the leadership of Yunnan province and Lunan county government. In 
the next year the Shilin management department was set up, which was responsible for the mana- 
gement of Shilin. In 1953, Shilin got the first international visitor, a Soviet delegation, and pre- 
mier Zhou Enlai made a special trip to Shilin and gave his approval for exploitation of Shilin. 
Since that time the government has invested in building tourist route, making the stone tables, 
planting flowers and trees, allowing Shilin to receive more tourists. From 1961 to 1965, different 
levels  of  administration  have  paid  attention  to  the  exploitation  of  Shilin.  Sooner  or  later  state 
leaders have visited Shilin giving the area a high reputation, and the number of visitors to Shilin 
landscape was increasing. 
     Unfortunately, the culture revolution, from 1966 to 1976, caused a lot of damage to tourism 
of Shilin. Not only the buildings were demolished, but also some scenery stones were damaged. 
Deforestation occurred in some places. 
     Since 1979, the scenic area of Shilin has stepped into a quick development phase, the first 
development  and  protection  promoted  phase,  which  can  be  called  modern  tourism  phase.  The 
government has recognised the scientific value of Shilin landscape, assuming that its exploitation 
will have a great influence on local economy and culture, so they began to look to strengthen the 
protection  of  Shilin  and  its  environment,  including  its  restoration.  In  1980,  the  Administrative 
Office  of  Shilin  Scenery  (Bureau  of  Shilin  Management)  was  set  up;  it  was  divided  into  five 
different departments. There were garden and forestry, agrarian pre-plan, tourist service, environ- 
ment protection, and publicity departments. It has organised experts to carry out the work of fully 
systematic investigation and estimation. In 1981 Shilin was listed as a province natural protected 
area covering 350 km2, mainly protecting the Shilin landscape and its geological phenomena and 

in 1982 it became a National Park. 
     In  1987,  the  state  ministry  of  construction  formally  approved  “The  Overall  Plan  of  Lunan 
                                                                                         2 
Shilin Scenic Area”. It defines the area of Shilin protected area (350 km ), and the whole area was 
divided into three zones with different protection levels. The first level includes Major and Minor 
Shilin  Scenic  areas  (Fig.  8),  Naigu  Shilin  area,  Ziyundong  Cave  area,  Qifongdong  Cave  area, 
Changfu Lake area, Yuefu Lake area and Dadeishui water fall area. The whole surface of the first

                                                                                                           2

                                                                                                             2 
protection level, similarly, is the buffer zone of second level areas, covering 306.1 km  (Fig. 9). 
Since then, they have made the detailed plan of scenic areas, which let the management of Shilin 
Scenic  area  move  into  a  next  phase.  By  the  “Protection  Act  of  Lunan  Shilin  Scenic  area”  the 
exploitation and protection of Shilin was set into the legal system (Wang et al. 1995). 
     In 1988, Shilin was listed as a state-level scenic area. Common people little by little under- 
stood the value of Shilin landscape and its scenery was becoming more and more known. From 
1990 to now, the Shilin Management Bureau has paid more attention to the protection of Shilin 
landscape and its environment. 
     A  lot  was  done  to  expand  and  to  improve  tourist  facilities  too.  In  1986  Naigu  Shilin  was 
opened  to  the  public  and  in  the  same  year  already  it  had  over  46,900  visitors.  Later  on  their 
number declined. In the same year also Dadeishui water fall area was opened to the public and 
has had 55,000 visitors that year. In 1988 Ziyundong Cave was opened and there were 64,500 of 
visitors. In the period 1980 - 1990 Shilin Scenic area has been visited by 10 million tourists and in 
1999 alone by more than 2 million.

     Therefore safeguarding and protecting of Shilin is becoming more and more important. Under 
the  auspices  of  the  “National  Ministry  of  Construction”  they  began  to  collect  material  for  the 
preparation of an application to inscribe Shilin into the list of World’s Natural Heritage at UNESCO. 
The  task  was  in  charge  of  Prof.  Xiong  Rouwei  from  Yunan  normal  University  and  Prof.  Xie 
Lingao from Beijing University within the co-operation of Yunnan normal University, Govern- 
ment of Shilin county, and Beijing University. In 1995 the International Symposium for Lunan 
Shilin  to  Apply  for  World  Natural  Heritage  Status  with  the  aim  to  confirm  the  justification  of 
Shilin’s  inscription  into  the  World  Heritage  list  was  organised  (Song  et  al  1997).  During  this 
event  number  of  Chinese  and  most  eminent  western  karstologists  evaluated  Shilin  from  very 
different points of view. Concluding remark by Zhang Yaoguang, the member of Chinese Aca- 
demy of Sciences was: “Lunan Shilin therefore has high values both to science and economy. It 
must be designated as a World Natural Heritage Site” (Song et al 1997, 95).

     It is self-evident that such a site needs protection and safeguarding measures. Some have been 
shown in the previous text already. With the increase of number of visitors human impact prob- 
lems are growing too. The most important are: 
-    quarrying, 
-    growth of population (urban growth), 
-    agriculture and stock breeding (pollution), 
-    soil and water loss (pressure on local water supply), 
-    mass tourism. 
     Quarrying has been a knotty problem of long standing in the management of Shilin. Although 
the Management Bureau has repeatedly forbidden the exploitation (destruction) of limestone pin- 
nacles as a source of rock material (Fig. 10), it could not stop it completely. In 1999, the county 
government and Shilin authorities made the big decision to stop it. They not only forbid quarrying 
activities inside the protected area, but ask the people who previously quarried to afforest the land 
and to carry out ecological restoration works in those areas. 
     The second important threat is the pressure of population towards the protection zone due to 
its increase. This can be seen through the pressure for new building plots (the inhabitants inside 
protected area occupy more and more land) and through the intensification of agriculture and its 
needs (farming and stockbreeding). The soil and water loss phenomena are becoming serious, the 
fertilisers used are also a potential pollution source of underground water. 
     The third impact is directly by mass tourism, due to the fast growth of visitor numbers which 
certainly makes a great pressure on environment and landscape protection work. In order to adapt 
the requirement of tourism, there have been built some tourist service facilities around the outer- 
ring of Shilin scenic spots, which is partially in contradiction to protection of the original Shilin 
landscape panorama. The relationship between protection and exploitation still needs further har- 
monisation. In order to adapt the application work, Shilin Management Bureau and government 
of Shilin county has decided to demolish some buildings and facilities which are inside scenic 
area and to construct new tourist facilities out of the core zone. 
     Management Bureau and Shilin Administration prepared special protection plans and measu- 
res,  including  special  organisation  of  human  resources  too.  Besides  the  delimitation  of  sectors 
with different steps of protection (core zone, buffer zone ...), the Shilin Administration introduced 
different protection measures. They have set up a special Environmental Protection Department 
under the Shilin Management Bureau. It consists of 18 persons, specially engaged in landscape 
resources and environmental resources protection. This department is under the leadership of a 
deputy  director  of  the  bureau.  Each  of  the  team  is  in  charge  of  the  protection  work  of  certain 
areas. They all have high school education. Moreover, the head or a person with high reputation 
of every village or township in the region is also engaged as a special ranger (volunteer), who is 
responsible for preventing the inhabitants damaging stone and nature resources. When they find 
out or hear something happening in a protected area, they go there to check it out and report to the 
leader of the management bureau. Interdiction of rock (limestone pinnacles) exploitation in the 
protection zone has been mentioned already. These special rangers are entitled to give advice to 
stone  pillars  destroyers.  If  the  advice  is  not  respected,  they  have  the  right  to  confiscate  their 
transport tools and equipment. And even more, they have the authority to fine the destroyers up to 
5000 Yuan. But for the bigger affairs all the leaders of Shilin directorate need to deal with and to 
harmonise it.

     Kitajski  izraz  “shilin”  (stone  forest)  po~asi  prehaja  v  mednarodno  kra{ko  terminologijo  in 
pomeni  “mega  {kraplje”,  “gozd”  mo~no  razjedenih  in  korodiranih  apnen~evih  stebrov,  visokih 
do  nekaj  10  m.  Razen  iz  Yunnana  so  shilini  znani  tudi  iz  provinc  Guizhou,  Hubei,  Hunan  in 
Sichuan.  Najbolj  znan,  prvi  opisani  in  tisti,  po  katerem  za~enjamo  imenovati  tak  pojav,  pa  je 
Shilin pri mestu Lunan (nekdanji xian - “county” Lunan, nedavno preimenovan v Shilin) v pro- 
vinci Yunnan, SE od prestolnice Kunming. Prvi znani zapisi o njem so iz 1382, pa tudi Xi Xiake 
(1586 - 1641) ga je verjetno obiskal na svojih potovanjih. Takrat so tudi prvi~ uredili del shilina 
za turisti~ni obisk. V moderni krasoslovni literaturi, ki govori o tropskem ali kitajskem krasu, kot 
primer shilina vedno nastopa Shilin pri Lunanu. 
     Shilin je postal zelo pomembna turisti~na to~ka kitajskega turizma. Z razvijanjem modernega 
turizma so pri~eli 1980 in v letu 1999 je obisk dosegel skoraj 2 milijona turistov. 1981 je bilo 
                                2 
celotno  podro~je  (350  km )  zavarovano  in  razdeljeno  na  ve~  podro~ij  z  razli~nim  turisti~nim 
pomenom  in  razli~nimi  varstvenimi  reæimi.  Pod  okriljem  “National  Ministry  of  Construction” 
zbirajo  gradivo  in  pripravljajo  vlogo  za  vpis  Shilina  v  seznam  svetovne  naravne  dedi{~ine  pri 
UNESCO. Tudi zato je ohranjanje in varovanje Shilina vedno pomembnej{e. 
     Vpliv ~loveka se kaæe predvsem v izkori{~anju (destrukciji) kamnitih stebrov kot viru surovi- 
ne, v pritisku prebivalstva na za{~iteno cono zaradi njihovega nara{~anja (potreba po novih grad- 
benih  parcelah),  v  kmetijski  (poljedelstvo  in  æivinoreja)  dejavnosti,  povezani  z  erozijo  prsti  in 
onesnaæevanjem podzemeljske vode (uporaba umetnih gnojil) in v hitrem nara{~anje {tevila obi- 
skovalcev. 
     Razen omenjene razdelitve na ve~ razli~no strogo za{~itenih obmo~ij, so povzeli vrsto ukre- 
pov:  stroga  prepoved  izkori{~anja  kamna  v  za{~itenem  podro~ju  (usmerjanje  k  pogozdovanju), 
gradnja  turisti~nih  naprav  izven  oæjega  obmo~ja  (in  odstranitev  takih  naprav  iz  tega  obmo~ja), 
ustanovitev  posebnega  oddelka  za  varovanje  (18  oseb)  v  okviru  uprave  Shilina,  pridobitev 
visokih in spo{tovanih oseb posameznih naselij za “specialne rangerje” - prostovoljne sodelavce 
uprave Shilina.
