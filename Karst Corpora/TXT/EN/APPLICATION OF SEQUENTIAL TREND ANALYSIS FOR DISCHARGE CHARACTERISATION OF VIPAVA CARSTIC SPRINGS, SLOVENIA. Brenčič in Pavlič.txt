                                                            GENERAL SETTING 

      The Vipava springs system is located in the western foot- 
      hills of the Nanos massive, which spreads from the flysch  
      margin of the Vipava valley. Seven permanent springs are  
      to be found within a radius of about 300 metres from Vi- 
                                                                      3 
      pava town (Fig. 1) with average discharge of 6.71 m /s.  
      Vipava  springs  react  simultaneously  to  precipitation  in  
      the recharge area. Lowest discharges are typical for sum- 
      mer months with minimum in July and highest discharg- 
      es  are  typical  for  April  and  November.  Average  water  
      temperature is 9.5 °C and oscillates between 8.5 °C and  
      10 °C (Janež et al. 1997). 
            The springs are located in a region where the deep- 
      est  erosion  of  low  permeable  flysch  beds  is  present  
      (Janež et al. 1997). quaternary deposits have partly filled  
      the  valley,  resulting  in  the  delta-like  appearance  of  the  
      springs. The lateral boundaries of the aquifer are repre- 
      sented by the flysch beds of the Bela stream valley, Vi- 
      pava valley and Pivka basin, although some waters from  
      the  flysch  also  drain  towards  Vipava  springs.  The  cen- 
      tral  part  of  Vipava  springs’  recharge  area  is  composed  
      of highly-permeable Nanos and Hrušica karstic massifs,

                                                    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Vipava springs have a typical karstic hydrological regime,  
reflected by short high-discharge episodes and longer pe- 
riods of average and low discharge (Petrič 2000). In the  
45-year  period  between  1960  and  2004,  minimum  dis-

charge  was  0.73  m /s,  average  discharge  was  6.71  m /s  
and maximum discharge 69.81 m3/s. The ratio between  

low, average and high discharges was therefore approxi- 
mately 1:10:100. 
       During     1960–2004,        maximum        discharges      were  
mostly detected in November and minimum discharges  
were typical for summer months. At Podkraj precipita- 
tion  station,  an  annual  minimum  of  1662  mm  and  an  
annual  maximum  of  3242  mm  were  recorded  in  2003  
and 1965, respectively.                                                        fig. 3: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between total an-
