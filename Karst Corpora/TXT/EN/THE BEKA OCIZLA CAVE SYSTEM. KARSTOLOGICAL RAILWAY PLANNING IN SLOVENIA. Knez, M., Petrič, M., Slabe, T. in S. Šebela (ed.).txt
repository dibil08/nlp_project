Preface 

A good knowledge of the natural and cultural heritage of karst is a precondition for the 
rational planning of life on it. The karst can be known and understood primarily through 
the comprehensive study of its surface, caves, waters, and ecological characteristics. 
   The Karst Research Institute of the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of 
Sciences  and  Arts  has  been  involved  in  developing  this  basic  knowledge,  estab- 
lishing interdisciplinary connections among the most important ﬁelds of karstology, 
and  in  consolidating  them  into  an  integral  science  of  karstology  for  almost  seven 
decades.  We  try  to  organize  the  knowledge  to  make  it  as  useful  as  possible  for 
planning life in karst regions and are directly involved in larger major projects. The 
Institute regularly publishes a selection of new research and knowledge. 
   Planning without a thorough understanding of the environment and consequently 
a  vision  of  its  development—even  though  within  the  boundaries  of  environmental 
protection legislation—is certainly not sufﬁcient. We wish to build a foundation for 
the rational planning of activities on karst based on good karstological research, as 
much in individual ﬁelds of karstology as in interdisciplinary studies. Such planning 
must  take  natural  and  cultural  characteristics  and  vulnerability  of  karst  landscapes 
into  consideration   and   overcome    the  inevitable  pursuit  of  proﬁt.  Environmental 
planning must realistically consider the socioeconomic conditions for the beneﬁt of 
local  karst  population  and  the  short-  and  long-term  development  of  karst  regions. 
While  the  mission of  the  Karst  Research  Institute  is  primarily to  expand  the basic 
knowledge of karst, karst phenomena, and karst waters, we are also aware of the need 
for  the  continuous  and  effective  communication  of  karstological  knowledge  to  the 
wider social community, including through our participation in the more important 
and directly useful projects. 
   Ten years ago the Karst Research Institute established a postgraduate karstology 
program  and  incorporated  karstology  courses  in  the  undergraduate  geography  cur- 
riculum. The International Academy of Karst Sciences, an international association 
of karstologists, was established to link international knowledge and experience more 
effectively and to ﬁnd the best foundations for the rational planning of life in various 
karst regions around the world. 
   The  Karst  Research  Institute  is  involved  in  individual  projects,  related  to  the 
development     and  protection   of  the  natural  and   cultural  heritage  of  karst  areas, 
regional  planning,  water  supply  systems,  the  construction  of  transportation  infra- 
structure, the closure of dump sites in karst areas, the collection of data on karst caves 
and their protection, karst ecology and determining the extent of human inﬂuence on 
the  karst  underground,  and  planning  and  monitoring  the  exploitation  of  karst  phe- 
nomena for tourism.

   We have assembled and published extensive sets of selected directly applicable 
research  studies  on  karst  waters,  results  of  our  participation  in  the  planning  and 
construction of expressways on karst, management of caves for tourist purposes, and 
ecology  and  protection  of  the  underground.  This  time  we  are  adding  experience 
acquired in karst planning of the railway route, one of the most demanding projects 
on Slovenian karst. We recognize that this does not include certain individual topics 
or the total contribution of karstology to planning life on karst, but we do hope they 
are a step in the right direction and a challenge for the future. 
    The  area  where  the  new  Divača  (435  m  above  sea  level)—Port  of  Koper  (0  m 
above  sea  level)  track  will  run  is  divided  into  two  sections.  The  ﬁrst  leg  will  run 
mainly   on   carbonate   rock   from   Upper   Cretaceous,    Paleocene,    and   Eocene.   The 
second leg will run on Eocene ﬂysch. The book presents results of the research on the 
northern section of the railway running on and through the karst. 
    The  route  of  the  railway  near  the  Divača  station  on  top  of  the  Classical  Karst 
plateau runs about 3 km on the surface and then enters the ﬁrst, 6,700 m tunnel (T 1), 
which ends in the  upper  part of the valley of the Glinščica stream.  After  a 250 m 
bridge the railway enters the second, 6,000 m tunnel (T 2). In some places the route 
runs more than 300 m below the surface. 
    The last part of the second tunnel passes from the Classical Karst plateau area to 
the ﬁrst, 450 m viaduct below the Črni Kal motorway viaduct. The route then runs 
almost entirely in tunnels T 3, T 4, T 5 and T 6, and in the penultimate T 7 tunnel 
turns south. With the last, 650 m viaduct the track nears the border with Italy and 
enters  the  ﬁnal,  3,800  m  tunnel  T  8.  The  route  continues  down  the  Rižana  River 
valley where the otherwise constant 17 ‰ grade eases. The track meets the Port of 
Koper loading station at sea level. 
    The  total  length  of  the  route  is  just  over  27  km,  which  includes  eight  tunnels 
(20.5 km, 75 % of the route), the longest two (near 13,000 m) running through karst. 
The route  also includes three bridges and two viaducts with a combined length of 
1,100 m (5 % of the length of the route). 
    During the initial planning stages, the northern section of the route of the future 
railway  across  the  karst  was  considered  part  of  the  ﬁfth  Pan-European  Transport 
Corridor Barcelona–Kiev.

    In the area of the Glinščica valley, the position of       the  numerous    joints related  to  the  aforementioned 
the caves depends on the alternation of carbonate and          nearby  faults  (see  Chaps.  3  and  5).  The  entrances  to

phology  of  the  cave  passages  is  also  controlled  by     the  northeasterly  located  slice  of  siliciclastic  ﬂysch, 
numerous    structural  unconformities,    such  as  faults,   then  pass  over   the so-called   transitional beds,   i.e. 
joints and bedding plane partings. The entrances to the        hemipelagic    marl  and   marly   limestone   (Jurkovšek 
discussed cave system and the morphology of its inner          et al. 1996),   and  sink  at  the contact   with  Eocene 
parts  are  also   strongly  controlled   by   the  contact    limestone.  Collapses  commonly  occur  in  the  transi-

The formation of the karst surface is a result of surface         the  surface.  Today,  these  are  hydrologically  inactive 
dissolution  of  rocks,  removal  of  the  rock  in  form  of     caves  that  bear  witness  to  the  oldest  developmental

   Due to tectonic raising of the entire Classical Karst          surface is being lowered, it cuts through numerous old

depth  of  48–48.7  m.  Cave  loam  was  found  also  at 
49–52.2 m. A cave system is probably located at the 
depth  of  30–52.2  m and partially  ﬁlled  up with cave 
loam and ﬂowstone or it is hollow. Thus the depth of 
this  cave  system  is  at least  22.20 m,  which  indicates 
greater karstiﬁcation and a larger cave system. 
    The rock again shows some signs of karstiﬁcation 
between  the  depths  of  87.5  and  93.5  m,  where  red 
loam    is  present.   Slight   karstiﬁcation    also   appears 
between the depths of 125– 130.6 and 176.5– 176.7 m. 
In  some  places  the  cores  are  tectonically  highly  ﬁs- 
sured, especially at the depths of 75–79 and 82–84 m. 
Tectonic     clay   was    also   traced   at   the  depth    of 
81.4–81.5 m. 
    Problems    with   drilling  occurred    at  the  depth   of 
around 180 m. That is why another borehole was made 
a  few  metres  away  from  it,  which  likewise  encoun- 
tered problems at the same depth. The third borehole 
made a few metres away from the ﬁrst two progressed 
up to 200 m without greater difﬁculty. At the depth of 
122.5  m  a  loss  of  drilling  mud  was  detected,  which 
indicates good karst conductivity. 
    A larger karst cave was encountered at the depth of 
192–200 m.                                                          Fig.  15  Flowstone  is  located  at  the  depth  between  68.1  and
