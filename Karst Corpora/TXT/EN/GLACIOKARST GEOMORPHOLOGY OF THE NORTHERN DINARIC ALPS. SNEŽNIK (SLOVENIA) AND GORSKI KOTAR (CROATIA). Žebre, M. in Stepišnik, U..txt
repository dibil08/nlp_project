    Snežnik and Gorski Kotar are mountainous areas in the Northern Dinaric Alps. We investigated                  Received 6 February 2015

    2011  and  2014.  The  result  of  the  ﬁeldwork  campaign  is  a  1:30,000  geomorphological  map           Accepted 14 September 2015

    Quaternary  glaciations  in  the  areas  of  Snežnik  and  Gorski  Kotar.  Along  with  the  map,  we 
    propose a legend for glaciokarst landscape mapping.
