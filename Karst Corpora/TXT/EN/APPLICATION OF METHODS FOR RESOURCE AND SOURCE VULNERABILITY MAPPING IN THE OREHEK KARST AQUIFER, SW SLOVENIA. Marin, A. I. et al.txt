Abstract In a shallow karst aquifer in SW Slovenia assessment of groundwater and drinking water source vulnerability has been performed using different meth- ods. The small, but well defined, Orehek karst is mainly drained by the no longer exploited Korentan spring. The recharge area of the spring is well karstified, densely wooded, and covered by thin soils. Besides precipitation, the spring is addi- tionally recharged by temporally active sinking streams. To assess the vulnerabil- ity, two methods, COP+K and Slovene approach, have been applied. Both methods provide tools for assessing vulnerability in carbonate rocks. They both rank among very sophisticated methods that require vast amounts of data, time, and financial and technical resources. Both methods share the same methodological proce- dure and consider the same type of information, categorized by the same factors. On the other hand, the scoring, classification and weighting of individual param- eters between the methods are different. Consequently, the resulting maps differ significantly. Major differences between the results are identified and discussed.

In addition, sensitivity analysis of individual factors have been performed and compared to cross-correlation, autocorrelation and water budget calculations. The results show high dependence of the COP+K method to the parameters char- acterizing the infiltration conditions (the so-called C factor) and distance to water source. The Slovene approach vulnerability classes are mainly influenced by thick- ness of the soil cover, presence of morphological features and the temporal hydro- logical variability that is justified by the performed statistical analysis.

1 Introduction 
Karst aquifers are becoming economically more and more important as they contain large amounts of good quality groundwater resources (Ford and Williams 2007). Due to special functioning and behaviour of karst aquifers (high permeability of aquifer systems, concentrated recharge and rapid infiltration of water, fast flow through karst conduits and transport over large distances), karst water sources are particularly vulnerable to contamination. Therefore, they need proper protection and management. 
Many national regulations concerning the protection of water sources are pri- marily based on the distance from the water source or the velocity of the ground- water flow to a spring. Often, the criteria do not consider the special features of water flow in karst, such as the heterogeneity and complexity of recharge con- ditions, the changes in the velocity and direction of water flow under diverse hydrological conditions, etc. However, almost two decades ago a concept of groundwater vulnerability mapping was recognized as an alternative to conven- tional regulations regarding the water protection (Vrba and Zaporozec 1994). In some countries, such as Switzerland and Ireland, the concept of vulnerability assessment is successfully used in determining water protection zones and plan- ning land use on karst (Dörfliger and Zwahlen 1998; GPS 1999). 
For such assessments, guidelines were elaborated, i.e., the European approach, in the framework of the international COST Action 620 project (Daly et al. 2002; Zwahlen 2004). On these foundations, numerous methods for assessing and map- ping the vulnerability of karst waters were developed that took into account dif- ferences between individual carbonate aquifer systems, accessibility of data, and economic capabilities. These methods were used and tested at various test sites around the world on a number of occasions. Reviews of some methods have been done by several authors, including Zwahlen (2004), Ravbar (2007), Goldscheider (2010), and others. 
Up to now, most complete implementation of the European approach and the most comprehensively designed methods are COP+K (Vías et al. 2006; Andreo et al. 2009) and the Slovene approach (Ravbar and Goldscheider 2007). Although these methods share common methodological procedures and require the same 
141 Application of Methods for Resource and Source Vulnerability Mapping 
information, a comparison study in a selected test site (Orehek karst) in SW Slovenia has been made. The aim of the study was to distinguish the main differ- ences between the two methods in the resulting resource and source maps. The maps have been evaluated and sensitivity analysis of individual factors has been performed. The obtained results have been evaluated by different statistical analy- sis of hydrological data. 
2 Description of the Test Site 
The Orehek karst area is a well defined shallow karst aquifer, situated in SW Slovenia. It covers an area of around 9 km2. A slightly uplifted ridge reaches up to 725 m in height above the surrounding 545–600 m altitudes. The aquifer consists of an anticline of Cretaceous and Palaeocene limestones (Fig. 1), which is in the SW partially thrusted over Eocene flysch and encircled by it (Gospodarič et al. 1970; Petrič and Šebela 2004). The Orehek karst is well-karstified with numerous dolines and 70 caves registered in the Slovene Cave Cadastre (2010). The carbonate rock in its northern part is covered with a thin layer of rendzina soil, and in the southern part with brown carbonate soil of various depths. The area is influenced by sub-continental climate with average annual precipitation of about 1,670 mm (period 1971–2000). In the same period an average annual run- off was about 900 mm. 
The aquifer is additionally recharged by several small sinking rivers on the SW (e.g., Črmelice, Orehovške ponikve) that are not permanent. On the NE margin of the aquifer very low permeable flysch acts as a hydrological barrier. Two temporal springs (Poliček and Mrzla jama) and a permanent Korentan spring drain the aqui- fer. Tracer test results proved the connection of the southern part of the aquifer and the Orehovške ponikve sinking stream with the Poliček spring at high waters. At low waters, the underground waters of the southern part of the aquifer flow towards the Pivka River situated further to the east (not shown on Fig. 1) (Gospodarič et al. 1970). The second tracer test performed at medium waters proved the connec- tion of the Črmelice sinking rivers with the Korentan spring. The groundwater flow velocity was estimated to be 25 m/h and the tracer recovery at 71 % (Schulte 1994). The main outflow from the Orehek karst aquifer, the Korentan spring, is a typical karst spring, characterized by rapid, sharp responses to precipitation events. Spring discharges range from a few l/s to about 3 m3/s with an average of 0.2 m3/s. Based on the results of tracer tests and the water balance method, the extent of the spring’s recharge area has been estimated and delineated to 6 km2 (including the non-karst part of the catchment: Petrič and Šebela 2004). The results of the water balance calculations infer, that the Orehovške ponikve sink- ing stream drainage area (marked as “Temporary, not confirmed” on Figs. 2 and 4) does not belong to the Korentan spring catchment. 
The results of daily and hourly time series analysis show low memory effect for discharge and high memory effect for electrical conductivity and

temperature of the Korentan spring. The storage capacity of the Orehek karst aquifer is therefore small, meaning that the spring reacts instantly to the pre- cipitation events in the catchment, which is typical for small and well karstified karst systems (Kovačič 2010). Small variations in the values and high memory effect of electric conductivity and temperature of the spring show that the auto- genic recharge is of much greater importance for the spring as the recharge from the Črmelice sinking river. 
Korentan has been used for local drinking water supply in the period 1955– 1972. A few years ago its reactivation as a reserve source has been discussed and a source vulnerability map using the EPIK method has been prepared in order to determine the water protection zones (Fig. 2). The map shows predominance of Moderate to High vulnerability of the aquifer. Very high vulnerability has been

assigned to sinkhole drainage basins and to areas with well-developed epikarst (Petrič and Šebela 2004; Kovačič and Petrič 2007). Unfortunately, until now no protection zones and regimes have been implemented and no further effort for the spring’s re-utilization has been made. 
3 Methodology 
In this study, two methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability, the COP+K (Vías et al. 2006; Andreo et al. 2009) and the Slovene approach (Ravbar and Goldscheider 2007) have been applied in the Orehek karst. Both methods take into account the specific properties of karst. The vulnerability assessment includes the geological, hydrological, and hydrogeological characteristics of a karst system and the precipitation regime. Relative to the purpose, two types of vulnerability assess- ment are available: for resource and for source (Daly et al. 2002). Assessment of resource vulnerability includes parameters that control the flow of infiltrated water from the surface all the way to the water table. Here, relevant factors include the permeability and thickness of the soil and rock composing the unsaturated zone (named O factor) and the concentration of runoff as influenced by topography, the karst features, the vegetation cover (C factor), and the distribution and intensity of precipitation (P factor). The additional K factor, which considers the characteris- tics of water flow in the saturated zone, makes it possible to assess the vulnerabil- ity of a water source. 
144 A. I. Marín et al. 
The COP method (Vías et al. 2006) was primarily designed for resource vulnerability assessment, but was later adapted for source vulnerability assessment and named COP+K (Andreo et al. 2009). The Slovene approach (Ravbar and Goldscheider 2007) is based on the COP method for assessing resource vulner- ability; therefore, some of the factors are differently scored or classified. In addi- tion, the Slovene approach has been extended for source vulnerability mapping. It also offers the possibility of considering the temporal variability of hydrologi- cal conditions and the linked protection of surface waters and groundwater. The method additionally includes guidelines for hazard and risk assessment, and con- siders the value or importance of a groundwater source or resource. 
In order to analyze and compare the resulting maps, the sensitivity analysis techniques have been utilized. This technique provides valuable information on the influence of each parameter on the final index. The maps have been fragmented to the “unique condition subareas” (UCS). A UCS contain one or more zones (consisting of pixels) where a unique combination of different parameters compose the final vulner- ability index (Gogu and Dassarges 2000). Then the sensitivity can be evaluated as: 
where Sxi is the sensitivity (for the ith UCS) associated with the removal of one map (of the X factor), Vi is the vulnerability index original on the ith subarea, Vxi is the vulnerability index of the ith subarea calculated without considering the X factor, N is the number of maps used in primary suitability (3) and n is the number of maps used in perturbed suitability (2). 
The sensitivity of each parameter for the whole catchment area is: 
where S is the sensitivity associated with the removal of one map from the whole catchment area, Sxi is the sensitivity (for the ith UCS) associated with the removal of one map (of the X factor), Axi is the percentage of surface area of each UCS and m is the number of UCS. 
As the values of the O factor vary from 1 to 15, while those of the C and P fac- tors vary from 0 to 1, it is necessary to divide the O value by the maximum value possible (15). Thus, all the variables have the same range (0–1) and the distortion produced in the sensitivity analysis results by the differences between the values of the factors is eliminated. 
This technique was applied, amongst others, by Gogu and Dassargues (2000) for the EPIK method, by Pételet-Giraud et al. (2000) for the RISKE method and by Marín et al. (2012) for the PaPRIKa and COP methods. 
Cross-correlation analysis of daily precipitation-discharge data, autocorrelation analysis of temperature and electric conductivity of the Korentan spring and water budget calculations of the aquifer have additionally been made to better character- ize the aquifer system.

4 Vulnerability Maps: Results and Comparison 
Figures 3 and 4 show the resource vulnerability maps and the percentages of vul- nerability classes. According to both methods, the karst aquifer is generally char- acterized by High vulnerability with some patches of Moderate vulnerability. This is using the COP method influenced merely by the land use, density of vegetation cover and slope inclination, while using the Slovene approach by the thickness of the soil cover, location of the morphological features and the temporal variability of the hydrological conditions.

The main difference between the vulnerability methods concerns the catch- ment areas of the sinking streams. These are characterized by significantly lower vulnerability by the Slovene approach due to consideration of temporal variability of hydrologic conditions and lower score of the variable distance to swallow holes. 
The results of the overall sensitivity analysis show, that both vulnerability assessments are highly sensitive to the O factor, less sensitive to the C factor and almost insensitive to the P factor (Table 1). The insignificantly small influence of the P factor to the final degree of vulnerability using the COP method has been previously also reported by Vías et al. (2010).

Fig. 5 Korentan source vulnerability maps obtained with the COP method (a) and the Slovene approach (b) 
Figures 4 and 5 show the Korentan source vulnerability maps and the percent- ages of vulnerability classes. Evaluation of source vulnerability mainly depends on data of predominant groundwater flow directions and velocities. 
These resulting maps are consistent with the results of the daily precipitation- discharge cross-correlation analysis that point to high vulnerability of the Orehek karst aquifer as well. The results proved fast reaction of the Korentan karst spring discharges to precipitation events and low storage capacity of the system, which is characterised by shallow vadose zone. 
Both, the COP+K and the Slovene approach methods clearly differentiate the direct recharge area from the southern sector of the aquifer, the connection of 
148 A. I. Marín et al. 
which has not been proven with the Korentan spring. In this area, vulnerability is considered Low. The COP+K shows significantly larger areas characterized by higher vulnerability in comparison to the results obtained with the Slovene approach. A distinct difference between the two maps is due to the weighting of the groundwater travel time and the K factor. In addition, the southern part of the aquifer that is presumably not drained by the Korentan spring is by the Slovene approach classified as of Low vulnerability, whereas the COP+K method classi- fies it as of Moderate and Low vulnerability. Nonetheless, lower vulnerability of these areas is in accordance with the results of autocorrelation analysis of tem- perature and electric conductivity of the Korentan spring and water budget calcu- lations of the aquifer that show that sinking rivers have very little or insignificant influence on spring water. The Korentan spring is mainly recharged by diffuse infiltration. 
5 Conclusion 
So far three vulnerability mapping methods have been applied in the Korentan spring catchment (including EPIK; Kovačič and Petrič 2007) resulting in three very different source vulnerability maps. Many studies have demonstrated that the application of different methods for vulnerability mapping at the same test site produced different or even contradictory results despite the use of the same data (e.g., Vías et al. 2005; Neukum and Hötzl 2007; Ravbar and Goldscheider 2009; Marín et al. 2012, and others). The present study showed that it is even so in the case when methods are based on the same methodological procedure, the same type of information, categorized by the same factors. The scoring, classification and weighting of individual parameters plays the most important role in assess- ing vulnerability degree. However, unless the results are verified, it is not certain which method produces the most reliable results. 
In this study, the COP+K method and Slovene approach that are very similar methods have been further analyzed by sensitivity, cross-correlation and auto- correlation analysis. The results show that the COP+K vulnerability maps are merely influenced by the land use, karst features, vegetation density and slope inclination data that compose the so-called C factor, and by the distance to the water source. The Slovene approach vulnerability maps are, on the other hand, influenced by thickness of the soil cover, morphological features and temporal vulnerability. The performed correlation analysis showed high vulnerability of the aquifer, its fast reaction to precipitation events and low storage capabilities, and justifies the introduction of temporal hydrological variability into the vulner- ability mapping. 
In the future, various conventional hydrogeological methods and techniques (hydrograph and chemograph analyses, tracer tests at different hydrological con- ditions), and previous studies of hydrodynamic response of the Korentan spring (Jemcov and Petrič 2009; Petrič and Šebela 2004) should be used to evaluate the 
149 Application of Methods for Resource and Source Vulnerability Mapping 
obtained vulnerability maps and to verify the used methods in detail. As only reli- able and objective interpretation of vulnerability indices can serve as a basis for the alternative protection zoning in karst, these should be as reliable as possible.
