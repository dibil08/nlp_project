Preface 

Thanks  to  the  successful  cooperation  with  companies  and  institutes  in  charge  of 
planning and building motorways,  i.e. the  Motorway Company of the Republic of 
Slovenia  (DARS),  the  Engineering  Company  for  Public  Roads  that  was  renamed 
DRI   Investment    Management       and  colleagues    from   the  former   Institute  for  the 
Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage of Slovenia–the Nova Gorica Regional 
Ofﬁce  and  the  Institute  of  the  Republic  of  Slovenia  for  Nature  Conservation–the 
Nova  Gorica  Regional  Unit,  karstologists  are  able  to  study  and  record  fascinating 
karst phenomena discovered in the course of motorway construction, which represent 
an important part of the Slovenian natural and cultural heritage. Furthermore, such 
collaboration enables up-to-date application of the fundamental knowledge of kars- 
tology to the planning of life in this sensitive region. 
   During construction, the earthmoving works have revealed a cross-section of the 
original karst surface, of the low and mostly covered karst of the Dolenjska region 
featuring  subsoil  stone  forests and  of  the unique  karst  that  can  be  observed  in  the 
breccia of Vipavska dolina (Vipava Valley). Over 350 new caves were opened in the 
karst region, including unroofed caves. 
   Research results have led to a number of new ﬁndings on the manner of the karst 
surface and underground formation, on the ﬂow of water through the karst aquifers 
and on the evolution of our karst on various types of rocks and in various conditions. 
   The  ﬁrst  part  sums  up  the  research  results  obtained  during  construction  on  the 
Classical   Karst,  newly   discovered    karst  phenomena,     research   of  sediments    and 
ﬂowstone, and dating thereof. It continues with presentation of construction on low 
and covered karst of the Dolenjska region and on the breccia of the Vipava Valley. 
The  next  section  is  dedicated  to  the planning  of trafﬁc  roads.  The  book concludes 
with studies on karst waters, their protection and biological characteristics. 
   It is our aim to preserve as many karst phenomena as possible, which is quite a 
challenge given that many caves are hidden beneath roadways and behind the rims of 
tunnels. 
   The  collaboration  described  above  can  serve  as  an  example  for  planning  and 
implementing various activities in the karst landscape, for familiarization with and 
for protection of the Slovenian natural and cultural heritage. 
   The book was written by researchers of the ZRC SAZU Karst Research Institute. 
Most  of  the  authors  also  teach  the  Karstology  doctoral  study  programme  at  the 
University of Gorica Graduate School and are members of the Unesco Chair on Karst 
Education. The study ﬁndings are effectively used in planning and implementing the 
programme  in  terms  of  the  course  content covering  the development  of caves  and 
karst aquifers as well as development challenges on the karst.

   Leon Drame, Franjo Drole and Jure Hajna took part in the ﬁeld research and the 
compilation    of  documentation,    and   Mateja   Zadel   helped   with  laboratory   work. 
Matters of administration were handled by Sonja Stamenković. 
   The   palaeomagnetic     research   concerning   the  age   of the  cave   sediments   was 
conducted in collaboration with colleagues from the Institute of Geology, Academy 
of  Sciences  of  the  Czech  Republic.  The  subsoil  shaping  of  the  karst  surface  was 
developed also within the Yunnan University International Joint Research Centre for 
Karstology and the Yunnan International Karst Environmental Laboratory. 
   Technical and text editing was provided by Alenka Možina, and translations by 
Milena  Djokić,  Andreja  Golob,  Darja  Mevlja  and  David  Bošković.  Pictures  were 
made by Iztok Sajko and Tamara Korošec. 
   The book was produced with the support of the Slovenian Research Agency. 
   We would also like to extend our gratitude to Acad. Prof. Andrej Kranjc, Ph.D., 
and Assist. Prof. Marko Komac, Ph.D., for reviewing our work.

running over the contact area has carved out the big- 
gest caves around. 
    For a number of years now, karstologists have been 
involved  in  the  planning  and  construction  of  motor- 
ways  in  the  Karst  (Bosák  et  al.  2000a,  b;  Knez  and

et al. 1998; Slabe 1996, 1997a, b, 1998a;  Šebela and 
Mihevc 1995; Šebela et al. 1999). When outlining the 
route of the motorways and railway lines, we make an 
effort  to  not  interfere  with  the  integrity  of  the  karst 
landscape,  and  to  bypass  the  more  important  surface 
karst  features   (i.e.  dolines,  poljes,   collapse   dolines, 
karst  walls)  and  the  caves  which  have  already  been 
discovered.    The    impact   of  the  construction     process 
and  the  use  of motorways  on  karst  waters  are  exam- 
ined in greater depth. Motorways are supposed to be 
impermeable, which is why waters from the roadway 
are ﬁrst collected in oil separators and released into the 
karst in a puriﬁed state. 
    We have studied the impact of trafﬁc roads on karst 
water. Kogovšek (1993, 1995a) has examined the com- 
                                                                     Fig.  1.2  Exploring  the  cave  with  a  collapsed  roof  due  to  the

motorways. The stagnant waters, which were found in 
smaller quantities in the caves along trafﬁc roads, con- 
tained traces of mineral oils (Knez et al. 1994). 
    In  the  scope  of  motorway  construction,  we  carry           large-scale  earthmoving  works  during  the  digging  of 
out karstological supervision (Fig.  1.2). Additionally,             roadcuts  and  tunnels.  Our  task  is  to  study  these  fea-

upper  layer  of  the  doline  inﬁll  is  made  up  of  brown 
soil, with red loam resting 1.5 m below the surface. 
   The motorway construction works required that we 
remove    the   alluvium    from    the  ﬁlled   up   dolines 
(Fig.  6.1).  The  results  obtained  in  the  course  of  the 
preceding  research,  which  included  drilling  into  the 
doline alluvium, were thus conﬁrmed. Frequently, we 
found  considerable  amounts  of  older,  mostly  ﬂysch 
alluvium  in the  dolines. In one doline situated  in the 
Divača–Dane section the layer of ﬂysch gravel almost 
reached the surface. But it should be pointed out that 
there are many ﬁlled up dolines within alluvium-ﬁlled 
old caves that had lost their roofs at one point. Shafts 
were    formed     under    passages    which     once    had 
through-ﬂowing water. This water ﬂow deposited ﬂysch 
loam   and   sand  in  the  last distinctive  stages   of the 
development of the passages. Later, in the dry periods 
ﬂowstone was deposited. These passages and shafts are 
permeated by inﬁltrating water which feeds the under- 
ground ﬂows. Today, the underground ﬂow runs deep 
below the surface. Funnel-shaped notches, ﬁlled with 
brown and red karst loam and rubble, were formed in the 
ﬂysch alluvium rain-washed by the surface water. 
   Near   the  town    of Povir,   a pond    (Fig.  6.2)  was 
created in a sinkhole, which was surrounded by partly 
man-made  walls,  because  water  had  collected  at  the

assumption that the water was prevented from draining            karst  surface  (Fig.  6.4).  The  people  transferred  rocks

Lower Cretaceous dolomite. However, they are mostly 
small  and  cannot  be  entered.  At  the  rim  of  a  doline, 
some  10  m  east  off  the  route,  a  30  m  deep  ﬁssured 
shaft had opened, with a stepped shaft not far off. 
   Dular  (1993a,  b)  established  that  Palaeocene  and 
Eocene  limestone  and  Cretaceous  dolomite         are  less 
karstiﬁed   and   Upper    Cretaceous     highly   karstiﬁed. 
Indeed, Palaeocene limestone close to the Čebulovica 
hill is scarce with old caves, and there were no shafts 
discovered. The poor cavernosity is also indicated by 
the banks of the large roadcut under  Čebulovica hill, 
which  featured  two  small,  hollow  old  caves  and  one 
alluvium-ﬁlled cave. There are relatively many caves 
in  the  Palaeocene    limestone    lining  the  route  from 
Divača to Dane. That section is pitted with old caves 
—hollow and alluvium-ﬁlled—and ﬁssured shafts. 

6.3.2     Old Caves 

The caves, which are remains of former early subsur- 
face water ﬂows in this part of the Karst, are made up 
of networks of slating passages with a diameter of 1– 
5 m, and dotted with smaller chambers. The passages 
were created by a slow water ﬂow, which is indicated 
by  the  complex  system  of  meandering  passages  and,

the  cave  was  completely  ﬁlled  with  deposited  sedi- 
ments  of  ﬂysch  origin.  Now,  the  alluvium  is  disap- 
pearing  in  a  smaller  subsidence  which  opened  in  the 
middle of the lower part of the cave. The subsidence 
is around  6  m  deep,  its  bottom  and  walls  covered  in 
sandy  sediments. 
   Next to two distinct ﬁssures which cross the cave in 
the lower part, two larger chimneys are formed, down 
which  rainwater  ﬂows  into  the  cave.  The  percolating 
water  is  highly  aggressive  as  evidenced  by  the  lime- 
stone walls of these two chimneys, which are heavily 
corroded.    The    ﬂowstone,     which    was    previously 
deposited in these parts of the cave (Fig.  13.2), is also 
considerably  eroded.  In  the  middle  part  of  the  lower 
passage,  next  to  the  larger  chimney,  another  smaller, 
side  chimney  is  open  along  the  fault  plane  that  runs 
parallel  to  the  direction  of  the  main   passage.   The 
foraminifera  limestone  is  corroded  to  such  an  extent 
that the shells of foraminifera and of up to 2 cm large 
sea urchins are jutting out from it. At the same time, 
rain  ﬂutes are forming along the fault plane that runs 
parallel with the main passage. 
   The cave was most probably formed already in the 
phreatic zone and was later ﬁlled with ﬂysch alluvium, 
with  a  lot  of ﬂowstone  deposited  as  well.  The  water 
now ﬂows through the deeper parts of the karst (Beguš            Fig.  13.2 Corroded  ﬂowstone  (a  curtain  and  a  stalagmite)  in 
et al. 2003).                                                    the midsection of the cave

water  ﬂowing  down  the  walls  or  the  ﬂoor  in  layers, 
creating  coatings,  waterfalls  and  canopies.  The  cave 
features   quite   a  lot of  ﬂowstone      in  various   forms, 
ranging    from   pools,   curtains,   stalactites  and   stalag- 
mites. Different forms indicate different ways in which 
water  ﬂows  and  in  which  the  ﬂowstone  is  secreted. 
The  ﬂowstone  is  mainly  yellow  and  brown,  with  the 
exception  of  translucent  helictites  and  a  few  translu- 
cent stalactites which are in the process of growing. 
    In   the   upper     part   of   the    cave,    translucent 
multi-shaped and multi-oriented helictites are growing 
from    the  ceiling,   walls   and   stalactites  (Fig.   13.5). 
Helictites  are  a  less  frequent  form  of  ﬂowstone  and 
grow  from  capillary  water  that  trickles  through  thin 
channels,  usually  through  transverse  ﬁssures  in  sta- 
lactites. The growing helictites follow the principles of 
crystallization rather than gravity. Colourless, white or 
yellow, they come in various shapes, with two being 
predominant,     namely     thin,  long   straws   that  turn  in 
different directions while growing, and short, thick-set 
monocrystals similar to smaller horns. 
    The ﬂoor of the upper part of the cave is covered in 
ﬂowstone crust and a large number of pools in various 
sizes. Water is still ﬂowing into most of the pools, while 
                                                                     Fig. 13.5   Helictites growing out of stalactites in all directions 
a large pool at the back of the cave has probably been dry

which  the  western  part  of  the  research  route  runs,  is 
one   of the  many    non-typical   depressions    along  the 
Dolenjska    lowland,   with   ﬂuviokarst   being   the  pre- 
dominating landscape type. It is located at the contact 
of the Upper Triassic dolomite on the northern side of 
the  valley,  and  the  Jurassic  oolitic  limestone  on  the 
southern   side.  In  view   of  its diversiﬁed   geological 
composition,    locally   varying   water   permeability   or 
generally poorer  water permeability can be expected. 
The uvala is the lowest part of the Šentvid area. Given 
the dimensions of its bottom, the depression could be 
deﬁned as a karst polje. Due to the absence of a larger 
sedimentary ﬂatland at the bottom, and since most of 
the  rim  has  not  been  closed  and  therefore  does  not 
have  the   form  of  a  typical  Dinaric   karst  polje,  the 
depression    is  termed   uvala   (Gams    1987).   Surface 
streams   (the  Dobovščica,    Šentviški   potok   and   Glo- 
govnica streams) ﬂowing from dolomite sink in oolitic 
limestone. During heavier rainfall, the water also ﬂows 
into  the  uvala  from  the  west  and  the  east.  When  the 
waters  are  higher,  smaller  springs  increase  consider- 
ably and extend the surface water course towards the 
southeastern edge of the uvala. Prior to the motorway 
construction, ﬂoods in this area occasionally hindered 
the trafﬁc on the old main road (Gams 2004). Quicker 
drainage of the surface water and smaller scope of the 
ﬂoods,   along   with   adequately   permeable    sinkholes,

The typical pointy shape of the upper sections of the 
pillars is due to the dispersed percolation of the water 
through the soil-covered plaster. 
   On the last test, the somewhat larger plaster pillars 
(the bigger ones were 20 cm in diameter, the smaller 
ones 15 cm, and both were 25 cm high) were covered 
with a ﬁner-grained loam which is less permeable for 
water  (Fig.  21.6).  The  contact  between  the  loam  and 
the  rock  reﬂected   this. First, subsoil  shafts  formed 
between the pillars. As a result, vertical subsoil ﬂutes 
formed in the upper sections of the pillars; these ﬂutes 
were   a  part  of  the  shafts  and   had  funnel-shaped 
openings on their tops. The openings were up to 3 cm 
in  diameter.  It  seems  that  when  the  contact  between 
the  plaster  and  loam  is  poorly  permeable,  the  water 
tends  to  ﬁnd  paths  that  are  the  most  conductive  and 
merges  them  into  streams.  This  assumption  was  also 
conﬁrmed by the bubbles on the surface of the water 
which revealed several distinct ponors. Special ﬂutes, 
such as those described in the test above, formed in the 
lower   section  of  the walls   of the  pillars and   were    Fig. 21.6  A subcutaneously sharpened top of a gypsum column 

shaped    in the   locally  ﬂooded    zone.  Anastomoses 
formed on the lower plane of the pillars. 
   At the top, the pillars became gradually sharper and        loam  were  narrower,  making  the  model  less  perme- 
tip-shaped.  The  test  was  suspended  several  times  in     able.  The   surface  of  the  plaster was   weathered    in
