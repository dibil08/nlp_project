PREFACE Environmental introduction, focus of a great fate, contamination deal and of transport research. is an of Most issue contaminants investigations worldwide into and have impacts the environment, focused public on health, granular and ecosystems, specifically (porous) and and into fractured resource groundwater, aquifers. availability. has Far been The less a 
attention has been paid to the contamination of karst aquifers. 
Case studies have demonstrated that the movement of contaminants in karst aquifers is poorly, if at all, predictable. On one hand, contaminants may travel rapidly through the aquifer due to direct input, open pathways, and high flow velocities. In contrast, under other conditions, contaminants may be stored in the aquifer for long periods of time and gradually released at low concentrations. There have been a substantial number of studies of the movement of specific contaminants in specific aquifer locations – case studies – but much less consideration of more generalized concepts of contaminant injection, storage, transmission, and release. More importantly, much less attention has been given to the actual impact of contaminated karst aquifers on public health. Given the importance of karst aquifers as water resources worldwide, it behooves us to consider (1) how contaminant movement differs in karst aquifers and (2) what is the consequent threat to people who use these waters? 
This conference was convened in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to provide a comprehensive overview of groundwater contamination in karst aquifers and its impact on public health. The Puerto Rico karst is especially significant in that it provides drinking water for private residences and for municipal water supplies and, at the same time, has been significantly impacted by unlined landfills and industrial contamination. Speakers were invited to present current research findings while providing the broadest possible topical coverage and including the widest possible range of points of view. 
The program was arranged with keynote and invited speakers plus contributed oral and poster papers. A session of snap talks was held for those who wished to make short or last-minute reports. Abstracts for all presentations except the snap talks are given in the following pages. The presentations have been arranged to present the tools available to investigators for assessing contamination problems, transport and remediation for specific contaminants, exposure concentrations, impacts on human health, and the regulatory framework. 
Two field trips gave attendees direct acquaintance with the Puerto Rico karst and its environmental problems. The mid- conference trip visited the San Juan Estuary. A two day field trip through the karst of the north coast followed the conference for attendees to see the spectacular cone and tower karst of Puerto Rico and a few of its caves and to gain some insight into the often hidden threats to the groundwater that flows beneath the dramatic landscape.

To completely understand a cave system, we have to characterize the geological, geometrical, physicochemical and biological properties and study the relationship between them. The geological properties provide us with information for the speleogenesis of the cave; this can be found from a literature review of the region. The geometrical properties consisted of the cartography of the cave in which the path, area and volume can be calculated using caveGEOmap and lidar measurements. The geometrical measurements were collected by using a laser digital distance measurer, clinometer, and a compass to create 2-D and 3-D maps of the cave. These can be used as a reference for the other properties that were measured. For our study the geophysicochemical properties consisted on the chemical composition and properties of bat guano droppings that can be used to understand the mycological settings for guanophillic fungi and mesofauna. The geobiological properties were the characterization of the fauna of the cave by catch-and-release traps. For the traps, the specimens were collected and classified by biological orders as a function of the depth of the cave. Based on these properties we can study the cave’s possible health impacts to humans such as water transport of bacteria, fecal coliforms, histoplasmosis, and others. At this conference we will present the results of two case studies; Angel Matos and Efrain Lopez located in the municipalities of Arecibo and Isabela, respectively.

1234 Roth Blvd., Clawson, MI 48017 USA 2Department of Geosciences, Deike Bldg., The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16801 USA *rachel.bosch@gmail.com Karstic aquifers carry a load of clastic sediment as part of their hydrologic function. Clastic sediments are an important part of the mechanism for storage and transport of contaminants; indeed, solid contaminants can be considered as a form of clastic sediment. Although the sources of clastic sediments have been well delineated, sediments from mul- tiple sources are mixed and redistributed within the aquifer to produce the sediment deposits observed in caves or the load of sediment discharged from karst springs. As an aid to the interpretation of clastic sediments in karst aquifers, a facies concept has been devised based on the traditional criteria of sedimentary petrology. Facies are defined in terms of particle size, degree of sorting, and sedimentary structures. The deposits represented by each set of facies characteristics in turn can be interpreted in terms of depositional mechanisms. The facies interpreted as slackwater cave deposits, here referred to as slackwater facies, are laminated deposits of clay to silt laid down in passages filled with stagnant water either flooded by inputs from upstream or backflooded from surface streams. This mechanism provides two pathways by which microorganisms or metals can be ad- sorbed onto clay particles and carried into the aquifer. The facies interpreted as channel cave deposits, here referred to as chan- nel facies, consist of silts, sands, gravels, and cobbles carried in major conduits mostly by high velocity storm flows. Flows that transport sediments resulting in channel facies also can carry solid contaminants at various size scales and can act as storage sites for contaminants over long periods of time. Calculations show that hydraulic conditions required for transport leading to deposition of channel facies are consistent with observed discharge characteristics of major conduits.

Limited filtration and turbulent flow make karst aquifers susceptible to microbial contamination. Groundwater tracers typically used in karst terrains include fluorescent dyes and latex microspheres. Not only can these tracers be cost-prohibitive, depending on the system being studied, but they may not accurately mimic the transport be- haviors of bacteria and other potential pathogens, and thus may not be good proxies for risk assessment involving microorgan- isms. This study examines the movement and attenuation of two serotypes of Escherichia coli (E. coli) with differing attach- ment efficiencies compared to traditional tracers (rhodamine WT dye and 1-μm diameter fluorescent microspheres). E. coli is quantified by molecular methods (qPCR) and dual stable isotope analyses using enrichment levels of 13C and 15N. Transport of the tracers is being evaluated for (1) vertical infiltration through the epikarst above Crumps Cave near Smiths Grove, KY fol- lowing storms and (2) lateral flow within a karst conduit aquifer near Lexington, KY under baseflow conditions. Breakthrough curves show differential behavior among all of the tracers within the epikarst, with the isolate containing the iha gene having later breakthrough curves than the isolate with the kps gene. Field data on survival and transport of agricultural isolates of E. coli can be applied to improve transport models and used by regulatory agencies for making decisions to mitigate bacterial contamination of water resources in karst terrains.

One challenging area is the thinly-mantled karstic Paleozoic plateau in the southeast which, in contrast to the rest of the state, does not have a cover of thick glacial sediments left over from the last Ice Age. In this region, it is often a struggle for drinking water protection to strike a balance between well-defined regulatory policy and the hydrologic uncertainty associated with karst sys- tems. As the distinction between surface water and groundwater becomes poorly defined, potable groundwater sources within the state become more susceptible to surface contaminants, such as nitrates from increasing agricultural activities and animal waste from feedlots. The dynamic nature of sinkhole formation also creates contamination hazards, such as the collapsing of sewage lagoons. Issues such as these have necessitated the development of practices and regulations unique to karst. Through drinking water monitoring programs, wellhead protection plans, and well construction guidelines, the Minnesota Department of Health aims to protect these drinking water sources in the state’s karstic corner.

Department of Geological Sciences, University of Florida, 241 Williamson Hall, P.O. Box 112120, Gainesville, Florida 32611-2120 USA *amy.brown@ufl.edu Little is known about how trace metals accumulate and cycle in conduits within the phreatic zone. These water-filled conduits can receive flood water that allows metals to accumulate, similar to air-filled caves, but are more susceptible to reducing conditions following floods because oxygen is limited to dissolved concentrations. If sufficient reactive organic carbon is transported into the aquifer, oxygen consumption will lower Eh and mobilize manganese and iron. To evalu- ate this accumulation and mobilization of metals, we analyzed the geochemical and isotopic composition of water, solid metal oxide, and limestone samples from two phreatic systems in north-central Florida where river water displaces aquifer water following storms. River water was a net source of trace metals to the aquifer; however, manganese depletion in the interior of the metal oxides relative to concentrations in intruding river water indicates not all metals are retained in the aquifer as redox conditions changed. The metal oxides are actively incorporating metals from floods, with anthropogenically-sourced lead from surface water on the outer portion of the metal oxide. Strontium isotopes indicate metal oxides form after river intrusion from a mixture of river and spring water, which have distinct 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Isotopic and geochemical evidence indicate that there is net accumulation of metal oxides in the aquifer, but not all accumulated metals are permanently sequestered. Understanding the conditions that trigger metal sequestration and remobilization is critical to managing water quality.

Mammoth Cave National Park in south-central Kentucky, an International Biosphere Reserve since 1990, is the world’s largest cave with over 400 miles of passages and a cave ecosystem that is linked to the surface through groundwater recharge. Groundwater quality in the Mammoth Cave region of Kentucky is critical to the cave’s ecosystem, tourism, and the health of the Green River. However, the same hydrogeologic processes that formed the cave make the karst system vulnerable to contamination. Many of the natural storm-drainage flowpaths go directly to sinkholes. It is well known that pre- venting contamination of the groundwater is preferable to remediation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the effectiveness of temporary check dams used to impede transport from a surface sewer leak into the cave. Three quantitative tracer studies were conducted in 2014-15 to test the effectiveness of the check dams. The presence and absence of two tempo- rary check dams constructed with pea-gravel were the main variables in the studies. The dams increased mean residence time on the surface from approximately 2 to16 hours, providing management more time to implement waste recovery. The dams also reduced the quantity of dye entering the cave by 90%. Temporary check dams provide emergency responders with an ef- fective way to impede contaminants from entering the karst groundwater system at Mammoth Cave National Park.

Although stationary, plants are masters of mass transfer and extract water, nutrients, carbon, oxygen and all that is needed to be the dominant terrestrial, multicellular biomass on earth. Plants concurrently change their environment while collecting and storing chemicals and elements from the surround- ing water, air, and soil in the environment, all by harnessing the energy of the sun and wind. Phytoforensics is an approach to gather this information using novel sampling and chemical analysis techniques developed at S&T, offering not just screening, but long-term monitoring possibilities. Fundamental breakthroughs in understanding plant-contaminant interactions have led to novel approaches that now being used in the new field of phytoforensics. Recent findings show a clear relationship of in-planta concentrations of volatile organic compounds and the potential for vapor intrusion into homes. Plants in the urban environment occupy the same environmental volume as homes and can therefore offer a quick, robust screening tool to test for potential in-home exposures. The time-weighted sampling that trees provide are not subject to the variability of in-home sampling and thereby provide reliable assessment of subsurface pollutants and an additional protective, cost effective protection of human health.

The complexity of local karst hydrology often prevents the efficient removal of contaminants through the use of traditional pump-and-treat methods. Bioremediation, in some instances, is a viable remediation option, with suitable hydrological, geochemical and microbial site conditions. Tracer studies are essential for characterizing site hydrology and estimating residence times. Sample collection and evaluation of the geochemical conditions and existing bacterial types are critical as part of the site evaluation. Supplements have been used to stimulate specific microbial populations and foster geochemical conditions which enhance or stimulate degradation or immobilization of the contaminants in a karst aquifer. Bacteria indigenous to Tennessee and Kentucky karst systems are well adapted to a variety of metabolic capabilities and aquifer conditions. Non-traditional groundwater models that incorporate residence time distribution and decay rates are useful tools in the remediation decision-making process.

The study uses secondary data obtained from a subset of participants of the Puerto Rico Testsite for Examining Contamination Threats (PROTECT) project that follows a cohort of pregnant women and their exposure to contaminant agents. This study includes a profile of PROTECT participants by geographical region, study site, and other socioeconomic characteristics related to an increased risk of differential exposure to contaminants by means of use of personal care products. The analysis will include the study of socioeconomic and demographic variables, and the use of personal care products. The sample for this study consisted of those woman who participated in the completion of three questionnaires. Analysis of data collected reveals reports of use of products with higher concentrations of chemicals that have been associated with hormone disruption, and premature births, are not evenly distributed among the population participating in the study. The presentation will discuss the distribution of personal care product use and socioeconomic characteristics of the participants from diverse geographical sites in Puerto Rico. Results provide important evidence in terms of the social determinants of health such as geo- graphical location, neighborhood, age, education, gender and economic resources, and how they impact exposure to chemicals present in personal care products. The implications of the results for further research, as well as for community engagement, and public policy will be discussed.

Rita R. Colwell 
University of Maryland, College Park, MD and Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD USA The millions of deaths from cholera during the past 200 years, coupled with the morbidity and mortality of cholera in Haiti since October, 2010, are reminders that Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, remains a scourge. Based on work done on V. cholerae and related vibrios over the past 40 years and, more recently, in Haiti, we reported the isolation of both V. cholerae O1 and non-O1/O139 early in the Haiti cholera epidemic from samples collected from victims in 18 towns across eight Arrondissements of Haiti. The results showed two distinct populations of V. cholerae coexisted in Haiti early in the epidemic. As non-O1/O139 V. cholerae was the sole pathogen isolated from 21% of the clinical specimens, its role in this epidemic, either alone or in concert with V. cholerae O1 could not be dismissed. A combined climate analysis and genomic approach was used to examine the similarities and differences among the Haitian V. cholerae O1 and V. cholerae non- O1/O139 isolates from patients and the environment were sequenced and compared against more than 200 Vibrio sequences. Comparative genome analyses of V. cholerae isolated in concurrent epidemics outside Haiti and our V. cholerae genomes data- base demonstrated substantial diversity of V. cholerae and ongoing flux within its genome. Furthermore, historical analyses of climate variables strongly indicate an environmental driver in the Haiti epidemic.

Based in Puerto Rico, it is a research consortium led by Northeastern University, University of Michigan, and the Uni- versity of Puerto Rico and its theme is preterm births, births occurring before completing 37 weeks of gestation. Puerto Rico has a long-standing history of preterm births, with the highest rate of any jurisdiction in the United States and third highest worldwide. Medical risk factors do not explain the high rate and Puerto Rico has the highest density per square mile of waste sites recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency, most are located in the northern karst area, the selected study site for PROTECT. The core study for PROTECT centers on a prospective epidemiologic study of 1,800 pregnant women that examines the role of phthalates and other endocrine disruptors on preterm births. A unique aspect of this program is its intersec- tion of geology, meteorology, and engineering with biomedical sciences. The research results of geologic studies in the northern karst area, are informing the epidemiologic analysis of this program and providing new insights on how contaminants diffuse and lead to exposures in humans. PROTECT is a strong model of transdisciplinary science that is advancing new knowledge that can be translated into a healthier environment and healthier people.

Taylor St., M/C 922, Chicago, IL 60612 USA sdorevit@uic.edu Pathogenic microbes that contaminate karst groundwater have caused infectious disease outbreaks. The microbes respon- sible for these outbreaks have also caused disease in the setting of surface water recreation. To protect the health of the public at beaches, regulatory frameworks have been established, which involve water monitoring and public notification. These monitoring and notification programs 35 years ago involved culturing fecal indicator bacteria and summarizing water quality days or weeks after sample collection. Presently, the use of rapid molecular methods allow same-day notification about water quality, in some cases through social media or text messaging. In the context of research, not only are indicator mi- crobes quantified, but likely sources of those organisms can be identified. Pathogen monitoring methods have been simplified in recent years and have been deployed in the field in studies of water and health. Additionally, a surveillance system tracks waterborne disease outbreaks that have been identified by local and state health departments. 
In this presentation, the potential relevance of the above approaches to karst groundwater is described. The potential advantag- es and disadvantages of performing karst monitoring for public health purposes will be addressed. Critical information needed to inform the design of such a monitoring and notification system will be described. Locations for such monitoring could be prioritized based on demographic, population health, pollutant source, hydrologic, and other factors. Leveraging existing karst groundwater sampling activities so that infectious agents can be monitored in addition to chemical and physical analytes may be beneficial.

World-wide approximately 25% of the population are fed by drinking water resources from karst aquifers. Karstic catchments require a sustainable protection. The increasing impact to such regions and different land use in the watersheds of karst springs are important reasons to establish early warning systems and quality assurance networks in water supplies. Microbial fecal pollution belongs to the most endangering contaminants in alpine karst aquifers. However, until recently, microbial fecal pollution could only be detected by traditional standard approaches based on individual grab sampling and time demanding cultivation procedures in the laboratory. Hardly any information on the pollution dynamics, origin of pollution as well as associated health-risks (in case of exposure) could be given. Due to this lack of knowledge, a joint effort between the disciplines of microbiology and hydrogeology was undertaken to open the “black box” of pollution microbiology by developing new techniques and strategies which guide resource and water quality management at catchments of alpine karst water resources. The final aim of the effort is to provide a sustainable framework which supports decision making at all required time scales of information (e.g. from near-real-time spring water abstraction management, within the resolution of minutes, up to catchment protection practices, within the time frame of months to years). The presentation regarding the microbiological aspects will cover, i) results on the evaluation of standard faecal indicators to indicate human and animal fecal pollution in the considered alpine environment, ii) the establishment of new molecular fecal source tacking technologies to guide target- oriented catchment protection, and finally, iii) to discuss strategies for translating the observed faecal pollution hazards into associated health-risks to assess the required level of water treatment (disinfection) for a sustainable drinking water supply according to health-based quality targets.

The difficulty is partly a result of the significant heterogeneity and anisotropy created by the existence of open and plugged ramiform conduit systems, but is also a result of the existence of an overlying epikarst. Even more intractable is the effective remediation of contaminated karst aquifers for basically the same reasons. The difficulties associated with investigating and remediating karst aquifers are further exacerbated when situated in areas with complex folding and faulting of strata. Couple the specifics of various contaminant types of varying degrees of reactivities, densities, and miscibilities (e.g., VOCs, LNAPLs, DNAPLs) with the complexities typical of karst terranes and the limitations of comprehensive karst investigations and effec- tive remediation techniques quickly become evident. Typical remediation techniques, such as pump and treat operations, in situ thermal treatments, in situ chemical oxidation, bioremediation, and monitored natural attenuation all exhibit significantly reduced performances relative to other types of aquifers. Partially in recognition of the challenges associated with specific contaminant types and groundwater investigations and remediation techniques when applied to contaminated karst terranes the U.S. EPA developed the concept of a TI (Technical Impracticability) waiver in which remediation below MCLs (maximum contaminant levels) may not be required. Very few TI waivers have ever been issued, however and obtaining a TI waiver is quite formidable. Remediation down to MCLs is a desirable goal, but the vagaries of karst terranes fully justify the concept of a TI waiver at some complex sites.

Department of Earth Sciences, Tennessee Technological University, 815 Quadrangle Drive, Cookeville TN 38505 USA *rjgardner43@students.tntech.edu The understanding of contaminant transport and the communication between surface water and a karstic aquifer requires a detailed hydrologic investigation, including installing several stage monitoring stations, establishing rating curves, col- lecting continuous discharge data, and dye tracing. The Boils in Jackson County, Tennessee is one of the largest springs in the state (average discharge 3 m3sec-1) and the site of a Wildlife Management Area as well as two State Scenic Rivers. The karst system occurs mostly in the Ordovician Leipers Limestone unit. In the upper basin there are risks for contamination from municipal sewage plants and a proposed landfill. Throughout the basin many residents rely on the aquifer as a drinking water source and for agriculture. A semi-quantitative dye trace was carried out by injecting rhodamine WT at a swallet on Spring Creek, a Tennessee State Scenic River, 9.4 kilometers from the Boils, and injecting Tinopal, an optical brightener, at a swallet on the Roaring River 1.8 kilometers from the Boils. Dye was recovered by collecting water samples, activated carbon, and cotton. The injected RWT traveled to the Boils (a distance of 9.4 km) in approximately 24 hours, implying little attenuation of contaminants. This is the longest dye trace carried out through this geologic unit. A quantitative trace is planned in order to determine the attenuation and travel time more precisely, from different swallets in the basin, to the Boils.

Southern Environmental Technologies, Inc., 900 Old Sewanee Road, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA *Southernenvironmental@earthlink.net In June, 2014, the Government of Bermuda contracted with Southern Environmental Technologies, Inc. to map Bassett’s Cave on the island of Bermuda. The cave is located under a former U.S. Naval Air Station Annex and suffered severe en- vironmental impact and degradation during military activities from 1940 until 1990. There is thick viscous oil floating on the tidal pools in the cave and steel drums are visible in one of the entrances. Four cavers from Tennessee, Marty Abercrombie- Environmental Scientist, John Hoffelt-Professional Geologist, JP McLendon- Ecologist and Maureen Handler-Environmental Engineer (the owner of Southern Environmental) travelled to Bermuda to map the cave, flag the cave on the surface, estimate the quantity of oil in the cave and sample the drums. In addition, Southern Environmental worked with the site General Con- tractor to advise on implementing remediation in the cave. During mapping of the cave, historic signatures dating back to 1779 were discovered. Another discovery is the appearance of unusual effects (biological?) on the formations from the environmen- tal impact.

Department of Applied Health Science, School of Public Health, Indiana University, 1025 E 7th St., Bloomington, IN 47405 USA Hendryx@indiana.edu Mountaintop removal is an aggressive form of surface coal mining practiced in Central Appalachia. People who live near these mining sites express concerns about the damage to water and air quality caused by this mining, and the corresponding impacts on public health, but until relatively recently empirical evidence was lacking. This presenta- tion will describe the progression of a research line proceeding from secondary analyses of epidemiological data, to community health surveys, to the beginnings of environmental exposure assessment studies in laboratory and community settings. Early studies documented significantly higher covariate-adjusted mortality rates for populations in mining versus non-mining areas. Other secondary analyses revealed higher rates of poor birth outcomes and adult morbidity indicators. Community surveys helped to confirm health disparities on finer geographic scales. Environmental sampling began to document the levels and types of air and water contaminants present in mining communities, and most recently, the first connections have been made between environmental conditions and biological markers of effect. Particulate matter from mining communities, for example, has been shown to promote lung cancer progression in vitro. More remains to be done, but the example of mountaintop remov- al provides a ‘case study’ in moving from anecdotal to research evidence on an environmental health concern. Lessons learned may be useful in developing a research base to understand public health impacts from karst groundwater contamination.

objectives of this research were to characterize the major pollutants in storm runoff, and analyze the treatment efficiency of the current filter system with the objective of improving efficiency. Tracer studies were conducted to establish flowpaths for the monitoring network on the surface and in the cave. Regression analysis found correlations between various chemical parame- ters and parking lot size or storm intensity and frequency. In general, the storm filters were effective at removing hydrocarbons (>90%), but less effective at removing copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and quaternary ammonia compounds (QAC). Sorption studies using filter materials, zeolite, perlite, and activated carbon, indicated that the filters adsorbed 65% and 52 % for zinc and cop- per, and 26% for QAC within 24 hours. The lessons learned from this study show that the chemistry of parking lot runoff varies by parking lot size and storm properties, and alternative stormwater management practices should be considered to improve the treatment efficiency.

A test reported from Switzerland in 1872 used NaCl to show that the source of a typhoid epidemic was sewage in a stream sinking in a neighboring valley and the tracer reached the town’s water-supply well within 24 hours. The town of Lewisburg, West Virginia is situated on a mature karst plain with no nearby surface streams, and simply allows all the domestic wastewater to disappear into the porous epikarst without any treatment. Tracer tests conducted in the 1970s determined that the sewage reappeared 10 km away at Davis Spring on the Greenbrier River with a travel time of 18 days. The town of Union also lacked sewage treatment and this water reappeared at a spring 2.7 km distant with a travel time of less than 2 days. The family using this spring for their drinking water reported a case of typhoid fever. Union still discharges (treated) water to a sinking stream. Walkersville, Maryland suffered a broken main sewer line that leaked undetected into a sinkhole for three days and a tracer test (and bacteria levels) forced the closure of the town well for several weeks.

National Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA *douglasgouzie@missouristate.edu and aj@nwmissouri.edu The Tri-State Mining District of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma (TSMD) experienced roughly a century of mining, end- ing around 1970. Impacts included: non-ore waste rock disposed near production centers, emissions from smelters (dis- persing metals into top soils), and post-mining subsidence associated with abandoned mine shafts. In the early 1980s, the USEPA designated Tar Creek (OK), Cherokee County (KS) and Oronogo-Duenweg (MO) as Superfund sites. Areas within the TSMD still exhibit Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations exceeding safe levels. Data show that sediment metal median values remain at or above guidelines recommended for aquatic habitats, and the highest Pb and Zn concentrations spatially are associated with the former mining and smelting centers. Increased levels of contaminants within aquatic sediments has been correlated with a decrease in biodiversity, and population sizes of invertebrates, mussels and fishes from stream reaches located downstream of mining activities. Because invertebrates and fish are important food sources, the potential for biomagnification and health impacts is considered high. Accumulation of Pb and other metals is consistent with studies from other regions. Birds studied in the TSMD had increased blood, liver and kidney concentrations of Pb, Cd and Zn compared to birds from reference sites. Zinc was noted to have the greatest impact in waterfowl. These observations imply that mine wastes remain a problem and further remediation is needed. Continued monitoring and remedial practices are needed until affected areas recover completely.

It is important since there is no catchment area determined for CH by the United States Geologi- cal Survey (USGS). The goal is to obtain a faster and more cost-effective method to describe the physical boundaries of a karst groundwater catchment area. By correlating discharge data from the USGS, and rainfall data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (NOAA, AHPS), the resultant map should show the physical boundaries of the catchment area in CH, at Río Tanamá. High rainfall resolution data obtained from NOAA, AHPS; and different interpolation tools in the Geographic Information System (GIS) program ArcMap 10.1 were used to improve the isohyetal map of Río Tanamá at CH region. As part of the investigation, a yearly record measure of the Total karst Flow (TKF), and a calculation for the drainage area in CH and Near Utuado (NU) was estimated in Excel. However, the resultant map in this investigation does not show a direct relation with the boundaries of the catchment area in the study area; the results proved the relation between discharge graph high peaks and rain events.

However, limited information exists on current human exposures to environmental chemicals in Puerto Rico. Preliminary findings will be presented from an ongoing cohort study of pregnant women in the Northern Puerto Rico karst region as part of the “Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT)” program. Using a biomarker approach, exposure levels to a wide range of potentially hazardous chemicals have been explored, as have some early indicators of biological response. These results are being used to compare exposure distributions with other populations, study pregnancy risks related to exposure, and inform future efforts for intervention.

Department of Geology, University of Puerto Rico, Call Box 9000, Mayagüez, Puerto Rico 00680 9000 thomase.miller@upr.edu Late Cretaceous and Tertiary carbonates are the cave and karst formers of Puerto Rico. About 98% of Puerto Rico’s 2400 km2 of karst is developed on Oligocene-Pliocene carbonates restricted to the north (90%) and south (9%) coasts, with the remainder on Cretaceous limestones scattered throughout the interior. The climate is humid tropical, with rainfall of about 2 meters per year on the karst, except the rain-shadowed south. Some features, such as mogotes, cockpits, ramparts (huge case-hardened river levees), and bellholes formed by bats, appear to have little expression outside the tropics, and are likely to have climate-specific restrictions. 
Recent convergent plate compression arched the island, exposing older plutonic and metamorphic rocks in the cordillera, and likely contributed much of the jointing in the carbonate rocks. Cosmogenic dating of surfaces in the Luquillo Mountains of the east indicate this occurred by about 5 My BP. Uplift of the Tertiary carbonates was probably less than 600 m; high points of the northern karst rarely exceed 500 m a.s.l. today. Recent activity on this coast (Atlantic) has uplifted a marine terrace to about 80 m elevation, similar to elevations of nickpoints on some of the northern rivers, and in major caves. The lowered sea levels of the Pleistocene significantly enhanced the relief, and encouraged karst development below current sea level. As a result, the largest spring on the island – Aguas Frias – descends below sea level 15 km inland, and then ascends 30 m before resurging in the bank of the Río Manatí. 
The northern rocks mostly dip gently northward 4-5o to the Atlantic, and differential erosion has produced scarps, and/or long chains of mogotes along the E-W strike. Large level areas are covered with remnants of the reddish “blanket sands” (quartz and clays) of likely longshore drift. Rugged expanses of mogotes that drain into cockpits dominate most of the remaining area, although less-soluble beds of the diverse Cibao Formation produce expanses of rolling hills, and some streams that drain to swallets of the Aguada Limestone. Truncated and alluviated dry valleys, and caves, record a long history of stream invasion from the silicic highlands, and eventual capture, chiefly near the southern fringe of the karst. With care, the “chaos” of cock- pit karst is often recognizable as relics of progressive dissection via cockpit development within former valley thalwegs that crossed the karst. The few through-flowing karst rivers have entrenched 100-200 m in prominent canyons, and receive outflows from numerous springs in the neighboring holokarst platforms. These rivers also serve as convenient boundaries of the five karst blocs of the north. 
For its size, Puerto Rico has a large background of karst literature (dominated by Watson Monroe’s work), although much less concerns the 100s of caves except for accounts of exploration. Cave orientations are mostly controlled by the strike and dip, with occasional faulting or major joint sets playing a role. The location of major caves or systems appears related to long-lived dominance of the initial points of invasion on the Lares Limestone, by streams that have integrated either on the volcanic/plu- tonic highland rocks, or on the Cibao Formation sandwiched within the body of the karst. 
Most large caves, then, are found near the southern karst boundary, or in the uppermost units of the Cibao. Following initiation of a major conduit, a series of vertically superposed galleries develop as base levels migrate downward in response to vertical uplift. Recent cosmogenic dating in the famous Rio Camuy System indicates that by at least 4.5 My BP the Camuy had devel- oped a very large conduit that flowed eastward on the strike to join the Rio Tanamá. By 4 My BP it had swiveled 90 degrees north to flow independently in its modern down-dip course.

Thomas E. Miller 
Department of Geology, University of Puerto Rico, Call Box 9000, Mayagüez, Puerto Rico 00680 9000 thomase.miller@upr.edu Currently, over 40 major trash accumulation sites are known within caves of Puerto Rico, or in streamways leading to them. In addition, the routine use of septic tanks above and within caves and dolines in the North Karst is probably an even larger health problem. 
The common types of trash are typical of households: e.g. washing machines, refrigerators, stoves, used tires, mattress beds, etc. Mobility in these trash sites can be initially categorized as stream caves vs. dry caves. Trash dumped in streams travels long distances above and below ground as the discarded material is gradually pulverized and transported by conduit-filling floods. The Camuy Cave System is a classic example of a fully-formed river carrying material from upstream surface dumps into and through several kilometers of large conduits to its resurgence. Dry dump caves tend to be vertical pits (some exceed 50 m deep) at the bottom of which the trash accumulates, but which stays in situ. 
Septic tanks in the North Karst number in the tens of thousands, often constructed with complete disregard of EPA regula- tions and common sense. The classic example is that of the Montserrate urbanization 20 miles west of San Juan. This area of hundreds of residents contained at least 37 known collapse sinkholes prior to construction, most of which lead to caves 5-10 m below ground, and of which many connect beneath homes and buildings. Surface septic tanks discharge directly into the caves, the majority of whose entrances are also filled with voluminous trash.

In areas where soils are thin, there is a history of “brown water” events that occur in response to groundwater recharge. Sampling pro- grams in Kewaunee County indicate that ~42% of wells in the Town of Lincoln do not meet drinking-water standards due to the presence of bacteria and/or exceedance of the US EPA nitrate standard. As resource managers try to address these water-quality problems, there is no consensus as to whether the main source of fecal contamination is human or bovine waste. Dairy farming and associated crop production comprise the primary land use and manure is commonly applied to crop land. Within the town, there are approximately 13,500 cattle and 334 households. 
We completed a pilot project to assess whether sampling wells for enteric pathogens could be an effective method of assessing sources of fecal contamination. Sampling was conducted in May 2014 and involved pumping ~800 L of groundwater through hemodialysis filters. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to determine genome concentrations for microbial targets divided into three fecal-source groups: 1) human-specific microbes; 2) bovine-specific microbes; and 3) non-specific microbes found in fecal wastes of humans, bovines, and other animals. Results indicate that 7 of the 10 sampled wells were positive for fecal contamination. Future efforts will 1) use quarterly samples to distinguish septic versus bovine sources of contamination and 2) determine the timing of peak transport for viruses and indicator bacteria.

It is well known that the same characteristics that make karst groundwater systems highly productive also make them very vulnerable to contamination. Once in the subsurface, many contaminants move along and spread across flow lines, interact with media and environmental compartments, and react with chemical and biological entities. All of these processes occur within a highly dynamic and heterogeneous framework that affects the mobility, persistence, and potential exposure of humans and wildlife. Fundamental knowledge exists on many of these processes and several predictive and characterization models have been developed and applied to karst systems. Yet tremendous challenges and uncertainty are faced when trying to predict exposure, implement remedial actions, and manage contaminated systems, particularly in a changing world. This paper discuss- es the state of knowledge, modeling capabilities, and sources of uncertainty when assessing the fate, transport, and exposure of legacy and emerging contaminants in karst systems. Although applicable to many sites, the discussion will be framed around particular examples of extensive contamination in the karst region of northern Puerto Rico, and how these compare to more densely lithified karst systems associated with continental karst. It will focus on contaminants related to industrial, agricultural, and personal care activities. Despite the advancements made on understanding and modeling fate and transport processes, large uncertainty remains on: source and system characteristics, scale-dependent model applicability, spatiotemporal data resolution, and the effect of hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic intervention.

Among aquatic environments, karst aquifers represent one of the most important freshwater resources supplying water of 25% of the global popula- tion and 33% of the French population. 
We recently conducted multidisciplinary studies - associating hydrogeologists with clinical and environmental microbiologists in order to determine the vulnerability to contamination by the fecal bacterial indicator - Escherichia coli (E. coli) - including anti-bioresistant strains. 
We focused this study on a small karst system developed in chalk in Upper Normandy. This system has been extensively moni- tored for water, particle, and solute transport during the past 15 years, and belongs to the French national observatory network on karst (INSU/CNRS). It is a small binary system (~12.5 km2) which comprises a surficial watershed on the chalk plateau drained by a permanent creek (the Bébec creek). The creek is engulfed into a sinkhole connected to the karstic spring located at the foot of the plateau. Finally, a well used for water supply is located 130 m downstream of the spring. 
Abundance of viable or culturable E. coli was monitored on the surficial watershed (i.e. the upstream part of the system) and at the spring downstream under contrasting hydrological conditions (dry and wet). Both the resistance of the Escherichia coli population (436 isolates) to 17 antibiotics and the ability to survive in oligotrophic conditions at 10 °C were investigated. In addition, the occurrence of E. coli in biofilms at the outlet of the system was analysed by in situ experiment. 
The abundance of culturable E. coli in the karst aquifer reflected the previous contamination of the creek by run-off and soil leaching, both depending on the hydrological conditions and the land use. The contamination of the water by culturable E. coli decreased by about one to three orders of magnitude from the sinkhole to the well, mainly due to the strong dilution of the surface water within the groundwater. However, we demonstrated that E. coli could be trapped in biofilms. 
Viable E. coli were detected along the flowpath (upstream to downstream: sinkhole-spring-well) even during the dry period, whereas culturable E. coli were not detectable in the water. After a rainfall event, increasing contamination is combined with an input of a population of culturable E. coli able to persist in water less than two days and mainly resistant to antibiotics. Analysis of the phenotypic antibiotic resistance show that 10 - 23% of these isolates are resistant to two or three antibiotics. At the sinkhole, the structure of E. coli population in water –i.e. the ratio of A to B1 phylo-groups- varied with the hydrological conditions and a sub-population of more persistent E. coli strains are circulating in water in the dry period. Indeed, irrespective of the hydrological conditions, the karst system may also act as a permanent reservoir of viable E. coli even when culturable E. coli became undetectable in the drinking water pumped out at the well during dry period. 
In 2015, the main conclusions obtained in karst aquifer and rivers were reported to the stakeholders and to the French Ministry of Health, to assess the microbiological risk due to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to the DPSIR (Driving forces- Pressure- State- Impact- Response) concept.

Since groundwater transport occurs un- der relatively high flow rates in aquifers in karst terrain, the contamination spreads unfiltered to wells and other drink- ing water sources connected to the aquifer. Therefore, development of efficient technologies to remediate contaminated groundwater and minimize health risks is challenging but necessary. Electrochemical based technologies are a viable option for treatment of groundwater in karst regions. Our team is evaluating the use of solar panels to generate a low-level direct cur- rent through electrodes in wells and enable manipulation of groundwater chemistry by in situ electrolysis leading to reduction and/or oxidation of contaminants. This approach has several advantages: 1) it is sustainable and driven by a renewable energy source, 2) it environmentally friendly because it does not require the addition of solutions or chemicals into groundwater, and 3) the rates of redox reactions can be easily controlled by adjusting electric current intensity. Currently, we are optimizing the performance of the electrochemical reactors to induce reduction and/or oxidation transformation mechanisms of contaminants. The reactors are designed to be implemented in the wells and operate under groundwater circulation; they are tested for dif- ferent electrode properties such as materials, dimensions, arrangements and modes of operation as well as groundwater condi- tions such as flow and content of naturally occurring substances. The laboratory setups tested showed removal efficiency of more than 99% for trichloroethylene, which is primary contaminant of concern in our study. Solar driven electrolysis will be implemented in wells for in situ degradation of contaminants through sustainable and easily controlled formation of reactive species.

1Universidad del Turabo, Gurabo, Puerto Rico 2University of Puerto Rico at Carolina *ronaldtrichards@gmail.com The two most important aquifers in Puerto Rico are the North Coast limestone karst and the alluvial South Coastal Plain. Because of its karst nature, traditionally the North Coast limestone aquifer is classified as uniformly being at high risk. There are a number of unused types of data that can be used to look at the question if the North Coast limestone can be classified as uniformly at risk or whether it should be subdivided into smaller management units. Compared to recharge water, old aquifer water is warmer, has higher dissolved solids, and lower oxygen, suspended solids, nutrients, and aerobic microbes. The correlation between hourly groundwater levels and water temperature in observation wells was used to identify two areas at higher risk from superficial contaminants. The two areas are the adjoining municipios of Quebradillas/Camuy and Manatí/Vega Baja. The US Geological Survey has on the Internet real-time groundwater level and rainfall data from only one station in the North Coast limestone aquifer, Florida 7. This observation well is extremely well connected to the surface. Between 22 May 2015 and 18 September 2015 this station had 28 recharge events. This observation well has measureable increases in water level with only 5 mm of rain. On average this station reaches a maximum water level 2 hours and 40 minutes after a rain event. In the future it should be possible to directly measure the travel time from rainfall to production water by measuring the temperature of rain and production water at producing wells.

West Virginia University College of Law, P.O. Box 6130, Morgantown, WV 26506-6130 USA jesse.richardson@mail.wvu.edu Regulation of karst to protect groundwater and public health poses unique challenges to regulators. First and foremost, often no regulatory authority is assigned responsibility for karst. For example, in the United States the federal govern- ment lacks authority to directly regulate karst. State governments hold authority to regulate, but often fail to do so. Therefore, regulation of karst in the United States mostly falls to local governments, who often lack the resources and expertise to effectively regulate karst. 
In addition, the regulation is required (often constitutionally) to apply uniformly to the regulated community to avoid claims of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. Uniform regulation has been crafted in most settings. However, the karst environment is chaotic and each situation presents unique circumstances that call for variable approaches. In this context, standard regulatory approaches often fail to protect public health, and creative approaches often face legal challenge. 
This presentation describes the regulatory dilemma surrounding karst regulation and analyzes various regulatory approaches to karst. In addition, the speaker considers a variety of non-regulatory approaches that, in conjunction with regulatory approaches, may more effectively protect public health. The presenter concludes that education- of regulators, government officials, and citizens- must precede any regulatory or non-regulatory measures if those measures are to effectively protect public health and karst resources.

Department of Civil Engineering, University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez, PO Box 9000 Mayagüez, Puerto Rico 00681-9000 *vilda.riverade@upr.edu Well-developed conduit porosity and highly transmissive zones characterize karst terrains. These characteristics not only make karst aquifers highly productive and important freshwater resources for human consumption and eco- logic integrity, but also impart high vulnerability for contamination. As a result, karst groundwater systems may serve as a significant route for contaminant exposure and lead to potential public health impacts. Chlorinated volatile organic contaminants (CVOCs) are of particular concern because of their ubiquitous presence in the environment and potential health impacts. The study assesses potential associations between contamination of karst groundwater and that at the tap water point of use. GIS technology and statistical methods are applied to perform spatiotemporal analysis of the collected data. The analysis incorporates data gathered from regulatory agencies and current groundwater and tap water samples collected from residential homes. Results show extensive presence of CVOC in groundwater and tap water. Several CVOCs, including carbon tetrachlo- ride, tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethene are found at higher frequencies and concentrations in groundwater than tap water. Chloroform is found at higher frequencies and concentrations in tap water than groundwater. Spatially, contamination is found throughout the study area, with some hot spot clusters in certain regions. Temporal analysis shows a decreasing concentration trend for CVOC in groundwater, and high variability with no marked trend in tap water. Spatiotemporal analysis suggests that contamination comes from multiple sources and that association between tap water and groundwater contamination depends on the type of contaminant, spatial location, and time.

Marian Rutigliano 
US Environmental Protection Agency rutigliano.marian@epa.gov There are several reports of elevated levels of lithium in drinking water associated with effects on mental health outcomes and violent crime rates. Lithium has been found in levels therapeutic for psychoactive efficacy up to levels high enough to cause mild toxicity. These findings occurred in or near areas with underlying karst aquifers in the United States, Europe, and South America. The drinking water sources for the affected areas included both groundwater and surface water. The nature of the groundwater flow system and its direct connection to the surface in karst areas suggests that drinking water sources may be affected by karst processes. These studies are reviewed along with selected reports of other drinking water contaminants found in similar karst areas. Waterborne illness is often specific to drinking water supply, associated with storm events, or is accompanied by breach of infrastructure into geologic structures. These factors in the presence of karst features may result in wider, more unpredictable spread of illness and might not otherwise be amenable to usual engineering solutions. A conceptual approach is proposed for public health practitioners to evaluate disease and health epidemiology as a function of geologic causes of drinking water issues and to consider karst effects as a particular category or subset of medical geology.

An important parameter needed for the engineering design of poplar-based systems is the rate of groundwater uptake by the trees (evapotranspiration of groundwater = ETG). Using field data from monitoring wells at the site, the method of White (1932) was applied to estimate the ETG on a continuous daily basis. The White method estimates water consumed by trees based on diurnal fluctuations in groundwater elevations observed in well hydrographs. To perform the extensive five-year data analysis, an algorithm for auto- mating the White method calculations was developed and refined. The statistical analysis of the results showed that the highest median ETG values occurred in the third year of poplar growth (2014) for all the wells. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that for some years the wells with the highest median ETG values were located distant (more than 15 meters away from the phy- tobarrier), in contrast to expected behavior. In general, robust relationships between ETG, poplar growth and proximity to the phytobarrier could not be established for the period of study. Therefore, it appears the White method may not be an appropriate technique for evaluating the performance of a phytobarrier. Possible reasons include the lack of complete areal coverage by the phytobarrier, the young age of the trees, data scatter in the observed hydrographs, and a variety of simplifying assumptions associated with the method.

Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Goldschmidtstr. 3, 37077 Göttingen, Germany *msauter1@gwdg.de Karst groundwater resources are highly vulnerable with respect to anthropogenic impacts, such as wastewater infiltra- tion, because of focussed recharge and the rapid transport of dissolved substances in highly permeable conduit systems. Here, examples are presented of approaches in the quantification of wastewater impact on potable groundwater, which poses problems in many parts of the world as well as the transport of wastewater borne components in the phreatic zone of a karst aquifer. 
For the quantification of the total flux of wastewater in groundwater discharge, long-term records of chloride concentration of karst groundwater discharge in springs of the Jericho (West-Bank) area were analysed with respect to the wastewater borne component. Chloride is used as an environmental tracer for (1) groundwater recharge estimation and (2) anthropogenic impact quantification. The investigations required the determination of the natural background concentration of chloride in groundwa- ter. It was estimated by a combined use of historical data and a trend analysis for larger springs in the area and a range between 20 and 40 mg L−1 was found. Together with chloride concentration data for local precipitation, the long-term mean natural groundwater recharge was calculated with the chloride mass balance method. Recharge ranges between 25 and 50 % of the precipitation. The proportion of wastewater-borne spring flow was quantified by a chloride end member mixing model. The springs exhibited a wastewater-borne flow fraction of between 0 and 22 percent, calculated from recent samples. 
Mass transport and attenuation processes of trace organics in a karst conduit system were quantified by a multitracer experiment investigating differential transport of selected relevant micropollutants. The conservative tracer Uranine, and the trace organics acesulfame and carbamazepine were injected into a sinkhole as reference tracers together with the reactive compounds atenolol, caffeine, cyclamate, ibuprofen and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen). The breakthrough of the tracers was moni- tored at a karst spring at a distance of ca. 3 km. The breakthrough curves of the reactive compounds were interpreted relative to the reference substances. No significant retardation was found for any of the investigated micropollutants. The determined half-lives of the reactive compounds range from 38 to 1400 h (i.e. persistent within the investigation period) in the following order (from high to no observed attenuation): paracetamol > atenolol ≈ ibuprofen > caffeine >> cyclamate. The attenuation rates are generally in agreement with studies from other environmental compartments. The occurrence of the biotransformation product atenolol acid served as evidence for in situ biodegradation within the aquifer system. Finally, a selection of modelling approaches is shown believed to assist in the prediction of transport in matrix-conduit karst systems.

Geary M. Schindel, P.G. 
Edwards Aquifer Authority, San Antonio, Texas USA gschindel@edwardsaquifer.org Karst aquifers are one of the most vulnerable aquifer types to contamination from anthropogenic sources. In comparison to other aquifer types, karst aquifers are noted for their high secondary permeability and rapid recharge, groundwater velocities measured in kilometers per day, and little attenuation of contaminants. The release of hazardous materials into a karst terrain can result in a direct and rapid impact to groundwater resources and ultimately, to springs and rivers. Many communities have well developed hazardous materials response (HAZMAT) programs to contain and mitigate environmental hazards. However, first responders as well as resource managers may not understand some of the unique aspects of karst. This can result in unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences to public health though contamination of groundwater re- sources. Releases of fuel have even resulted in even explosive vapors in buildings and sewers. 
This presentation identifies common sources of hazardous materials and recommendations for an overall hazardous materials release strategy. This includes preplanning and training with HAZMAT team professionals, identification of potential receptors, source water protection planning, and hazardous materials response strategies in karst.

However, most of these are not very specific concerning the source of contamination. Organic micropollutants (OMPs) such as artifi- cial sweeteners or herbicides are possible source-specific indicators that can be used in karst catchment areas. Online measure- ment of electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity allows for identifying hydro-sedimentary processes by analyzing hysteresis- plots. We have investigated the possibility of combining the OMPs as source specific indicators with online measurements of electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity. Our investigations were carried out at the Gallusquelle karst spring in south-west Germany during a flood event. Results of OMPs are generally consistent. The legacy compound atrazine (herbicide), which derives from the aquifer matrix, was detectable in the spring water until re-suspended particles appeared at the spring. The herbicide metazachlor, which is present in recharge from cropland, was found to be associated with periods of direct transfer of particles originating from the land surface. The artificial sweetener cyclamate was used as a wastewater indicator, but neither hysteresis plots of EC and turbidity nor any other online parameters were able to indicate the presence of cyclamate following a wastewater spill. Since EC and turbidity are easily measurable parameters, systematic knowledge of relationships of EC turbid- ity hysteresis-behavior to OMPs might assist in the sustainable management of raw water within karst catchments.ABStRACtS

Michael Sinreich 
Swiss Federal Office for the Environment FOEN, Hydrology Division, CH – 3003 Bern, Switzerland michael.sinreich@bafu.admin.ch Microbial contamination remains by far the most common cause of quality degradation in karst groundwater resources and – in terms of drinking water supply – is highly relevant from a public health perspective. Significant here is the occurrence of fecal microorganisms at karst springs as well as its prediction on the basis of reliable hypotheses re- garding specific transport and attenuation processes. 
Monitoring which is well-adapted and which extends beyond conventional fecal indicator bacteria analyses – i.e. the detection of pathogenic bacteria and enteric viruses, or the application of human and ruminant molecular-dependent microbial markers – provides greater insight into the origin and fate of fecal contamination. Such impact information can be integrated into the framework of a general behavior scheme for microorganisms in karst settings. The total cell count represents another innovative parameter for microbial characterization of groundwater in this context. 
The simultaneous interpretation of diverse microbiological parameters represents a promising tool for source and pathway tracking – including storage and mobilization issues – and is particularly conclusive when viewed in relation to other markers, such as solute micropollutants. More quantitative information on transport behavior can be obtained from tracing experiments employing specific microorganism types or appropriate particulate surrogates. In this way, diverse processes can be identified and distinguished, such as preferential migration due to exclusion phenomena, interaction with differing surfaces encountered in the subsurface and associated attenuation, inactivation during storage or particle-attached transport. 
Monitoring data in conjunction with in-situ techniques provide the basis for process comprehension and allows the establish- ment of enhanced conceptual and transport models in relation to microbial contamination and karst systems in general.

Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation District, 1124 Regal Row, Austin, TX 78748 USA *brians@bseacd.org The Edwards Aquifer is a prolific karst aquifer system in central Texas that provides drinking water to about 2 million people. The presence of nonpoint source pollution in storm water flowing in Onion Creek can have a direct impact on water quality in the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer. To address this concern, the Barton Springs/Ed- wards Aquifer Conservation District constructed a concrete vault over the entrance to Antioch Cave in the bed of Onion Creek in 1997. This structure was designed to prevent entry into the cave of contaminated storm water by closure of two valves on the vault during storm events. In 2009, an automated system was installed to improve the efficiency of the system by closing the valves at the beginning of a storm pulse and opening the valves when the turbidity of the storm water drops below a certain threshold. Results of water-quality sampling at Antioch indicate that the system is capable of significant reduction of nonpoint source pollution entering the aquifer through Antioch Cave. Over a period in 2010 that included five storm events, approxi- mately 2,436 lbs of nitrogen from nitrate/nitrite, 295 lbs of total phosphorus, and 190,480 lbs of sediment were prevented from entering Antioch Cave. Dye-trace studies have shown that water entering Antioch Cave can reach Barton Springs in about 5 to 7 days. A set of monitor wells near Antioch Cave are used to monitor the potential for movement of contaminants in the aquifer.

Water resources from alpine and other mountainous karst aquifers play an important role for water supply in many countries. World-wide approximately 25% of the population are supplied by drinking water resources from karst aquifers. Karstic catchments require a sustainable protection. The increasing impact to such regions and different land use in the watersheds of karst springs are important reasons to establish early warning systems and quality assurance networks in water supplies. Microbial fecal pollution belongs to the most endangering contaminants in alpine karst aquifers. However, until recently, microbial fecal pollution could only be detected by traditional standard approaches based on individual grab sampling and time demanding cultivation procedures in the laboratory. Hardly any information on the pollution dynamics, origin of pollution as well as associated health-risks (in case of exposure) could be given. Due to this lack of knowledge, a joint effort between the disciplines of microbiology and hydrogeology was undertaken to open the “black box” of pollution micro- biology by developing new techniques and strategies which guide resource and water quality management at catchments of alpine karst water resources. In-situ measurements have to be adapted to the local contamination scenario and online and near real-time availability of data are obligatory. As faecal pollution cannot detected directly in near-real-time, proxy parameters are necessary to be established for on-line monitoring. The targets of the study were (1) to investigate the dynamic of microbial faecal pollution indicators, chemical parameters and environmental isotopes at a high resolution time scale during hydrologi- cal events, and, (2) to evaluate the Spectral Absorption Coefficient at 254 nm (SAC254) as an real-time pollution proxy for optimised spring water abstraction management. These investigations lay the foundation for advanced microbiological analysis and hazard and risk assessment (see abstract part II), the basis for catchment protection based on the Dominant Process Concept (DPC) - elaborated by the combination of process-orientated hydrogeological mapping and hydrological modelling – and a state-of-the-art multi barrier protection system of drinking water resources.

Department of Geological Sciences, Ball State University, 2000 W University Ave, Muncie, IN 47306 USA. *tgillesvalde@bsu.edu The proliferation of Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) around karst is controversial. Although studies have assessed the contamination risk of CAFOs in karst aquifers, little data have been published. This study looks at the load- ing of nutrients from weekly samples collected May through August 2015 at Grayson-Gunnar Cave (GGC), an 11-km- long cave system in Southeastern Kentucky. Surveyed passages in GGC include two branches of an underground stream with strong connections to surface input—epigenic karst aquifer. The south branch of this watershed includes low-density grazing and residential septic tanks. The north branch includes a poultry CAFO. 
Weekly water samples were collected at the cave spring; three samples were also collected from each of the two branches. Analysis of NH3, NO2, NO3, and PO4 were conducted on these discrete samples using a DR2800 spectrophotometer. Contem- poraneous data from the cave stream were collected every 10 minutes using a YSI EXO2 sonde. 
From the discrete samples, nutrient flux and sources were computed using a mixing model. From the sonde data, we elucidate aquifer behavior during storm events by looking at key indicators of meteoric water input from sinking streams (conductivity, turbidity, and DOM) and conducting correlation analyses to assess ‘lag’ times between input and output. Preliminary data from discrete samples reveal PO4 and NO2+NO3 levels consistently above the EPA standards of 0.1 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L, respectively. The sonde data reveal twin peaks in water chemistry consistently occurring following precipitation events, likely the result of merging flowpaths from two sub-watersheds.

These features make karst vulnerable to potential contamination of hazardous chemical substances. Detecting dangerous pollutants has posed a tremendous challenge, and has increased the interest to delineate and predict flow and transport processes in karst groundwater systems. Characterization and quantification of these processes at the field-scale is limited by low resolution of spatiotemporal data. Processes at the lab scale may not be representative of conditions at the field-scale, but can provide fundamental knowl- edge on characterization and quantification tools that can be applied at the field scale to enhance resolution. This work presents the development of an intermediate karstified lab-scale physical model (IKLPM) to study fate and transport process and assess viable tools to characterize heterogeneities in karst systems. Flow experiments are conducted to develop tomographic views of hydraulic responses. Tracer experiments are conducted to generate space-dependent temporal concentration distributions (TCDs) that are analyzed to characterize and quantify the variability of fate and transport parameters. Tomographic views and TCDs results show high spatial variability associated with paths of preferential flows. The outcome of this study will lead to characterize preferential flow path zones of potential pollutants such as PCE and TCE in karst groundwater systems that affect human health and the environment. The development of these technologies to predict fate and transport of contaminants will contribute to mitigate its exposure to the communities and reduce public health impact.

They are also highly vulnerable to contamination. Emerging contaminants, including phthalates, are of particular concern because they can easily enter karst groundwater through a wide range of distributed sources and move toward areas of potential exposure to human and wildlife. Many of these contaminants are known endocrine disruptors and potential precursors of adverse reproductive outcomes. Previous studies in the karst region of northern Puerto Rico have shown sig- nificant presence of phthalates in groundwater and tap water. This work develops spatio-temporal distribution of phthalates contaminants in groundwater and tap water in this region, and assesses potential correlations between hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors and phthalate contamination. Geographic Information Systems technologies and statistical models are applied to attain these objectives. Results show extensive phthalates contamination in tap water and groundwater samples that vary in space and time. They are detected as mixtures components in areas of high urban and industrial development. Statistical models show that the presence of phthalates in groundwater is significantly related to sinkholes density, hydraulic conductiv- ity of the aquifers and time. Although groundwater serves as route of contamination to tapwater sources, higher detection of phthalates in tapwater (53%) than groundwater (7%) indicates additional sources of contamination in the water distribution system that may be related to land use. The analysis indicates that phthalates persist for long periods of time in karst systems and that hydrogeological factors contribute significantly to their presences in these systems.

Ciudadanos Del Karso, 267 Sierra Morena, PMB 230, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00926 The karst represents 28% of Puerto Rico and it is a vital natural area for its many resources, i.e. biodiversity, spectacu- lar vistas and subterranean rivers and caves. It contains the most productive aquifers of Puerto Rico on which about 500,000 people depend, as well as industry, commerce and agriculture. 
After experiencing almost total deforestation by the middle of the last century, the karst region recovered and became the island’s heaviest forest cover, with immense value for tourism and other economic activities compatible with its natural values. Yet, by the 1990s we noticed a trend of urban sprawl and infrastructure development in the karst, which imitated what, was happening in other parts of the island where the environment was not as vulnerable as in the karst region. These developments threatened the natural values of the karst. 
Thus, we undertook an effort to protect the karst that involved research, public education, and citizen’s actions. One of those actions was developing legislation to protect the karst. The effort was successful and Law 292 was enacted in 1999, but the government was slow in its duty to implement the protective measures. Because of this, we were forced to increase our efforts through judicial action against the agencies responsible for the implementation of the law. After considerable years of litigation, a plan and regulations to protect the karst was finalized in 2014 and we are helping the government in its implementation.

In this study a new Geographic Information Systems (GIS) -based index, the Karst Aquifer Vulnerability Index (KAVI), incorporates geologic layers used in intrinsic groundwater vulnerability models (GVMs) plus an epikarst layer specific to karst, with land use coverages to create a specific groundwater vulnerability model. The KAVI model was compared to another specific vulnerability model, the Susceptibility Index (SI). Tabulation of the percentage areas of vulnerability classes reveals the SI overestimates vulnerability for the study area compared to KAVI. Validation of these two models found that KAVI vulnerability levels best reproduced spatially varying concentrations of nitrate in the aquifer. Both sensitivity analysis and the application of a variation index to KAVI confirmed the importance of closed depressions but also aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The inclusion of land use was justified; however, effective weight analysis determined its assigned weight was too high as used in the initial calculation of KAVI.

Given these studies, and our limited knowledge about contaminant movement in karst settings, it is critical that the toolbox of available tracers be enlarged. Toward this end, we have completed preliminary development and testing of hydrogel bead tracers as proxies for the movement of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL). The beads are inexpensive to make, biodegradable, and easily modified. The beads are primarily water (>95%) held in a calcium alginate gel. Modifications of the beads have included (1) adjustments to specific gravity by adding mineral particles or microscopic glass bubbles, and (2) incorporation of fluorescent pigments to aid in bead detection. 
The focus has been on the movement and detection of floating beads as proxies for light NAPL (LNAPL). In early tests the beads were collected manually; later the bead movement was quantified by exciting the florescence in the beads with LED lights and video-recording the movement. The video was then processed to separate the colors, calculate the pixel intensity of each frame, and plot the intensities through time to generate break-through curves. 
In field demonstrations, the beads traveled faster than the accompanying solute during higher discharge (140 L/s) and slower than the solute during lower discharge (9 L/s). Overall the field tests confirmed the need for more studies and tools to better understand NAPL transport.

A cave monitoring study has been going on since 2012 at Cueva Larga in Puerto Rico to elucidate the complex epikarst- cave-atmosphere processes influencing speleothem growth and climate proxy variations recorded in cave sediments (speleothems). Cave monitoring studies are essential to interpret speleothem climate records correctly. A suite of envi- ronmental cave atmosphere variables (cave air pCO2, temperature and relative humidity), carbonate precipitation experiments and outside weather station observations were collected at near monthly or higher resolution. 
The results show that carbonate precipitation in this tropical cave primarily occurs during winter months when increased cave ventilation boosts carbonate oversaturation of the drip water. This might cause a seasonal bias towards the winter growth season in speleothems from Cueva Larga. Drip water samples were analyzed for their isotopic and trace element composition. They lack short term or seasonal variability indicating dominant diffuse seepage flow and a well-mixed epikarst reservoir above the cave. This indicates that the cave is probably well suited for paleoclimate studies especially focusing on multi-decadal climate variations.

Department of Geosciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802 USA wbw2@psu.edu Karst aquifers differ from aquifers in porous media by the highly diverse pathways by which water and any associated contaminants travel from recharge to discharge. The effective hydraulic conductivities may vary by 10-12 orders of magnitude between alternate pathways through the same aquifer. There are three distinct contributions to the perme- ability: a system of pipe-like conduits with varying degrees of development and integration, a system of solutionally-modified fractures, and the primary permeability of the rock matrix. For any given aquifer, hydraulics and response to contamination inputs depend on the sources of recharge, the specific mix of permeability components, and the physical properties of the con- taminants – in effect a matrix of interactions. 
Categories of contaminants include water-soluble compounds, both organic and inorganic, low solubility liquids both heavier and lighter than water, and particulates, organic and inorganic, ranging in size from nanometers to meters. Inputs are through sinking streams, storm flow into closed depressions, and infiltration through soils that may be thin and discontinuous. Natural discharge is typically through large springs that are frequently used as water supplies. Features that separate karst aquifers from porous media aquifers are large aperture pathways that permit particulate contaminants to enter the aquifer with little filtration, localization of flow paths into conduit systems which constrict contaminant concentrations to a narrow pathway instead of spreading into a plume, high velocity flows which can move particulates and also transmit contaminants rapidly from point of injection to point of discharge. 
Storm flows are exceptionally important in the transmission of contaminants. Storm inputs raise the hydraulic head in the con- duit system, increase both flow volume and velocity, and can flush both clastic sediments and contaminants that have remained in storage in the conduit system. During base flow, the conduit systems act as drains with hydraulic gradient in the surrounding fracture and matrix pointing to the conduit. During storm flow, increased head in the conduit reverses gradients, forcing con- taminated storm water back into the fractures where it may intercept wells. Rising water levels can force the fumes of volatile organics upward to reach sinkholes and basements. Flooded surface streams may reverse the gradients in the master conduit systems and force contaminated surface water deep into the aquifer.

The study site is the 45 km2 rural catchment of the perennial karst spring Gallusquelle (SW-Germany). 
We used the artificial sweeteners acesulfame and cyclamate as source specific indicators for sewage along with the herbicides atrazine and isoproturon for agriculture. The combined evaluation of the persistent compound acesulfame with the rather de- gradable cyclamate allows for the distinction of long and short transit times and thus slow and fast flow components. The same applies for atrazine (persistent) and isoproturon (degradable). 
During low flow conditions only atrazine and acesulfame were quantified in the spring water. After a recharge event without sewage overflow, concentrations as well as mass fluxes of both compounds decreased, reflecting an increasing proportion of event water in spring discharge. A breakthrough of isoproturon indicated the arrival of water from croplands. After a recharge event accompanied by sewage overflow, cyclamate was detected at maximum concentrations of 28 ng L-1. Simultaneously, the variations of acesulfame concentration suggest the superposition of background dilution (old component) and a breakthrough (fresh component). The cyclamate breakthrough was successfully simulated with a 1-D-transport-model. The application of micropollutants as indicators is suggested as a very sensitive tool in karst hydrogeology, where natural background concentra- tions and signal damping are often limiting factors for conventional hydrochemical investigation.
