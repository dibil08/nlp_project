dant  precipitation  results  in  a  significant  contribution  
of new, less mineralized water in this trickle (Kogovšek  
2010). In trickle J a high degree of homogenization with- 
out larger oscillations is evident. The transfer of contam- 
inants, EC and discharge pattern and isotopic analysis of  
18O  (Kogovšek  2010)  reflect  the  structure  of  the  catch- 

ment area of the trickles and indicate a high level of ho- 
mogenization in the catchment area of trickle J, due to its  
hierarchy  of  variously  less  permeable  and  hydraulically  
connected fissures, in comparison with that of trickle I. 
      A  comparison  of  EC  and  Ca+Mg  indicated  linear  
dependency in both trickles (Fig. 4). For trickle I we ex- 
cluded samples taken at minimal discharges, when sig- 
nificant deposition of calcium carbonate occurs and the  
samples therefore do not reflect the composition of water  
flowing at the top of the flowstone formation. The cor- 
relation coefficient of Ca+Mg and EC was R2  = 0.97 for  
trickle I, and R2  = 0.99 for trickle J. It follows that in this           fig. 4: Dependence between EC and concentration of (Ca+Mg)

      Based on the above-mentioned results in Postojna Cave,                       It  is  therefore  necessary  to  anticipate  the  local  in- 
      we  can  conclude  that  localized  wastewater  sources  on             creased  dissolution  of  limestone  and  consequently  the  
      karst  terrain  that  discharge  directly  into  the  karst  en-        greater  permeability  of  fissures  and  conduits  in  karst  
      vironment,  and  probably  other  similar  sources  such  as           vadose zones for water and contaminants below waste- 
      leachate waters from landfills, foster the intense dissolu-            water sources with high concentrations of chlorides, ni- 
      tion  of  limestone  in  the  vadose  zone.  This  leads  to  the       trates, sulfates and phosphates. In the final phase of such  
      gradual  formation  of  local  increasingly  permeable  fis-            development, which takes many decades or even longer,  
      sures  that  drain  precipitation  containing  leached  con-            the relatively rapid transfer of contaminants through the  
      taminants from landfill sites ever more rapidly through                 aquifer all the way to karst springs can be expected. The  
      the  vadose  zone  to  underground  watercourses  and  on               increased  permeability  of  fissures  and  conduits  allows  
      to  karst  springs.  This  explains  the  rapid  percolation  of        the rapid transfer not only of soluble potentially danger- 
      tracer  through  the  vadose  zones  below  the  mentioned              ous substances but also of insoluble contaminants such
