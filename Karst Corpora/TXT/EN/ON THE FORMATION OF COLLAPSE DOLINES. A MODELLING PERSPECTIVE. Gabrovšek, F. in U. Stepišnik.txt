pathway and the exit. The head drop along the evolved pathway is 
small,  leaving  a  ﬂat  gradient  at  the  upstream  region  and  therefore 
preventing the evolution of other pathways. 
    As pointed out by several authors, the early evolution of fracture 
networks under constant head conditions is governed by a feedback 
mechanism       between     ﬂow    and   dissolution    rates.  As  the  ﬂow    rate 
increases,  high  dissolution  rates  penetrate  deeper  into  the  network 
resulting in even faster increase of ﬂow rate, until an abrupt increase 
of  both   quantities    in an   evolving    pathway     occurs   (Palmer,    1991; 
Dreybrodt, 1990; Dreybrodt and Gabrovšek, 2000). This event, called 
breakthrough, ends the initial state of network development. 
    The ﬁrst pathway in our network breaks through at 300 y (Fig. 4e, f). 
Soon after the breakthrough, the pathway is widened almost uniformly 
with maximal dissolution rates, determined by the saturation ratio of 
the input solution (Dreybrodt and Gabrovšek, 2000; Palmer, 2007). The 
breakthrough event also marks a transition from a laminar to turbulent 
ﬂow    regime.    The   head   distribution    in  the   network    is  rearranged 
(compare Fig.  4  c,  e  and  g),  so  that  the  gradient  for  other  potential 
pathways builds up again. The network of evolved (post-breakthrough 
pathways) is “inﬂating” towards upper and lower boundaries. At 800 y 
almost  half  of  the  fractures  in  the  domain  have  evolved  beyond  the 
breakthrough and continue to grow with uniform widening rate. 
    Fig. 5 shows the evolution of discharge and the annual amount of 
solutionally    removed      rock   (removal     rate)  for  different    scenarios 
presented in this paper. The removal rate R  [L3 /T] is deﬁned as the 

volume of dissolved rock per unit time. It is calculated according to the 
formula R=QM(cout −cin ) /ρ, where Q is the ﬂow rate, cin and cout are 
input and output concentrations of calcium, M  is the molar mass of 
calcite  and  ρ  its  density.  The  unrestricted  case  is  presented  by  the 
dotted line. If a constant head is kept at the input, the removal rates 
increase to a maximum value when turbulent ﬂow invades the entire 
network. However, for the unrestricted case this happens at ﬂow rates 
which are unrealistically high for most catchments. 
    If  widening of  the  fractures is unrestricted,  the  transmissivity  of 
the network inevitably reaches a value at which the recharge cannot 
sustain the constant head. Boundary conditions become controlled by                        Fig. 5. a) Evolution of the removal rate for unrestricted growth (dotted line), inﬁlling
