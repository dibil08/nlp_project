MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSES OF DOLINES  THE PROBLEM OF DELINEATION AND CALCULATION OF BASIC PARAMETERS
Ela Šegina, Čedomir Benac, Josip Rubinič & Martin Knez: Morphometric analyses of dolines:  the problem of delineation and calculation of basic parameters
So far reported unstable correlations between environmental settings and doline geometry require a revision of doline delineating methods and morphometric analyses that follows from such input data. We examine the reliability of the most accessible data sources for doline delineation, namely basic topographic maps at a scale of 1:5,000 and ortho-rectified aerial photographs (digital orthophotos) of 0.5 m resolution. Their reliability has been quantified in the Dinaric karst (Krk Island, NE Adriatic Sea). The adequacy of most commonly used morphometric parameters (viz. elongation and circularity) and their variations applied in previous studies are mathematically verified and practically tested. The simulation of an individual method behaviour performed on polygons with increasing circularity and elongation demonstrated their ranges of validity. The efficiency of a particular method was verified by the application to the real dataset of dolines. The optimal variation of an individual parameter (circularity = Pcc/Pd; elongation = . of the best fitting ellipse) is identified and suggested for use in order to provide uniform results and increase the comparability of future morphometric analyses. Asymmetry (the distance between the centroid of doline ground plan and the centroid of the largest inscribed circle) as an additional parameter for describing doline ground plans has been developed and is proposed for further use.

INTRODUCTION
Even though certain global conditions of doline formation related to climate, elevation, slope inclination, lithology, and tectonics have been successfully established (Gams 2000), on a regional scale, correlations between the geometry of dolines and environmental factors have often been quite variable or even weak. It was hoped that morphometric studies would reveal direct links between karst landforms and processes, but they have not satisfactory fulfilled such expectations (Day & Chenoweth 2013). Due to rapid data processing, its applicability to extensive and inaccessible areas, and its apparent objectivity, the use of remote sensing data in Geographic Information System (GIS) is proving a very promising method in geomorphology. However, its objectivity is subject to the scale employed, the use of correct algorithms, the interpreters subjectivity, and possible measurement and drawing errors.
The importance and the problem of doline upper rim definition have already been discussed by several authors (Bondesan et al. 1992; uteriè 1994; Æaliæ 2009; Telbisz et al. 2009). Even though being the most reasonable definition of doline perimeter, a principle of an abrupt change in surface slope (uteriè 1994) has seldom been used in practice due to its fieldwork requirements (Basso et al. 2013). Instead, the focus has been directed towards simplification and automation of the procedure. Previously, the most frequently used methods for doline upper rim delineation involved the use of topographic maps of various scales based on the assumption that the uppermost closed contour properly represents the doline perimeter (Bauer 2015; Denizman 2003; Telbisz et al. 2009). Recently, the delineation of dolines has become increasingly focused on automating delineation using digital elevation models (DEMs), combining DEMs and satellite imagery, or combining DEMs and diverse algorithms (e. g., Bauer 2015; Carvalho Júnior et al. 2014; Obu & Podobnikar 2013; Pardo-Igúzquiza et al., 2013; Telbisz et al. 2016). 
Besides the question of doline spatial extent, the main obstacle in morphometric analyses of dolines is their irregular geometry. The demand for a certain amount of generalization required for further morphometric analyses has led to several approaches which were applied without mathematical examination of their adequacy. Various parameters have been applied especially on the basis of doline upper rim (listed in Bondesan et al. 1992). Among them, two basic parameters for describing the perimeter shape of dolines, circularity and elongation, have been the most commonly employed (e.g., Basso et al. 2013; Bauer 2015; Denizman 2003; Plan & Decker 2006; Doctor & Young 2013; Carvalho Júnior et al. 2014; Kobal et al. 2014), but due to the variants of the parameters, the results from different places are difficult to compare. 
Circularity describes the irregularity of doline planar shape and defines its deviation from the perfect circle. The morphometric analyses in karst research applying circularity of doline upper rim mostly do not surpass an acquisition of rough results only. Due to the general tendency of dolines toward centricity, the deviation in circularity is theoretically expected to reveal the local differences in doline-forming processes, impure karst conditions or underground basis of contemporary doline shaping. Elongation describes the extension of doline planar shape in a particular direction. It is a dual-aspect parameter that describes the degree of elongation and its orientation. It is mostly presumed that its value correlates with a structural predisposition. 
Asymmetry has seldom been applied as a parameter for doline investigation. It may provide an insight into regional factors of spatially or quantitatively non-uniform removal of karst material such as lithological heterogeneity, local tectonic stress, ecological and microclimatic factors, etc. It has been previously calculated as a quotient between slope lengths in certain directions from the deepest point of a doline (Bárány & Mezosi 1991), a method that is unsuitable for sediment-bottomed dolines where the deepest point is not possible to determine superficially. 
Due to the unsatisfactory results of doline morphometric studies acquired so far, a discussion on method reliability is required. Difficulties may arise at every stage of data processing: 1) doline definition, 2) doline detection, 3) doline delineation, and 4) the use of suitable parameters in morphometric calculations. In this study, we focus on the issue of dolines planar shape definition (3) and the use of suitable parameters (4). It is expected that improved delineation methods or at least awareness of their deficiencies, and the use of appropriate mathematical operations will contribute to the uniformity of morphometric analyses and lead towards more stable correlations between landforms and processes on karst. 
METHODS AND TEST SITE
The delineating errors have been identified on the karst relief of Krk Island (367 km2) characterized by different vegetation types. Morphometric parameters have been tested on a smaller sample of dolines (Fig. 1, Tab. 1) located in a forested area, where preliminary observations indicated the smallest deviations in defining doline shapes (see also paragraph 4.1). All parameters were processed with ArcGIS 10.2 software.

On topographic maps at a scale of 1:5,000 the upper rim corresponded to upper closed contour. On ortho-rectified aerial photographs (digital orthophotos or DOFs) at resolution 0.5 m, the upper rim followed visual changes in surface representation that are connected to change in surface slope (shadow effect, change in vegetation). Additionally, upper rims of four dolines located on different vegetation types were determined on-field by the principle of the abrupt change in surface slope (uteriè 1994). Upper rims were obtained by the use of conventional GPS of the app. 3 m position error, where reference points representing the perimeter of the doline were measured at the interval of 10 m along the rim. By field examination on bare karst surface dolines of any size can be detected  the limiting factor of field recognition is the depth of the depression which enables distinguishing the doline from other surface irregularities.
We examined four existing methods for describing circularity and four for describing elongation of a doline planar shape (Tab. 2, Fig. 2). In addition to already published methods, we generated and tested the circularity as a deviation of the doline perimeter from the largest inscribed circle (Pd/Pic) (circularity method 5). 
A new method has been formulated to determine the degree and the direction of doline planar shape asymmetry (Tab. 2, Fig. 2). The distance between dolines ground plan centroid (Cd) and the centroid of the largest inscribed circle (Cic) indicates the degree of asymmetry, while the orientation of the connecting line between Cd and Cic determines the direction of doline asymmetry. 
There is no single approach that would work optimally in all circumstances. However, it was established that perimeters defined by orthophotos correspond very well to the actual rims determined by the field survey, but it is only true when the shadow effect is present. While location errors due to GPS positioning are negligible, digitized data are subject to shape and especially noticeable size errors (Fig. 5). Other vegetation types as bare karst land and areas covered by bushes and coniferous trees could be reliably mapped only by field survey. 
We are witnessing the expansion of methods for automated doline delineation and numerous tests of their reliability (Doctor & Young 2013; Bauer 2015; Obu & Podobnikar 2013; Pardo-Igúzquiza et al. 2013; Carvalho Júnior et al. 2014; Kobal et al. 2015; Telbisz et al. 2016). The effort is put in the increase of input data resolution, but the issue never considered is that such methods still follow the contour principle instead of actual doline upper rim. Field examination and comparison of different methods show that vertical irregularity of doline upper rim results in considerable shape and especially size deviations. Due to the vertical irregularity of doline upper rim, the automation of doline delineation using even high-resolution DEMs remains an unsolved issue.
CIRCULARITY
The simulation of an individual method behaviour performed on polygons with decreasing circularity (from n-angles convex polygon (circle) towards irregular concave polygon) (Fig. 6 a) shows that for the convex shapes, the method Pcc/Pd (1) define the circularity with the highest precision among all analyzed methods. In case of highly irregular (concave) polygons this ratio produces false results but as dolines are sub-circular in a planar shape, this is not a matter in issue. The range of methods validity is behind the applicability of the method in karst studies. The ratio 4.*Ad/Pd2 (3) is a reciprocal of the ratio Ad/.(2*Ad/Pd)2 (4) and both give results comparable to the ratio Pd/Pc (2). However, application to the real dataset of dolines (Fig. 6 b) did not allow the recognition of any region of validity for these three ratios. The ratio Pd/Pic (5) distinguishes between concave and convex polygons but is not as effective in distinguishing among sub-circular shapes (see the result for an 8-angles convex polygon in Fig. 6 a) as the method Pcc/Pd (1).
Choosing the most appropriate index thus primarily depends on a dolines planar shape geometry and the purpose of the morphometric analyses. For the purpose of describing doline sub-circular planar shape in karstological practice, the ratio Pcc/Pd (1) provides the most detailed results. However, one must bear in mind that in the presence of highly irregular (concave) shapes, this ratio can produce false results. Spatial representation of a suggested variant of circularity index is presented on a real dataset of 110 dolines (Fig. 7). 
ELONGATION
According to the simulation of an individual method behaviour performed on polygons with increasing elongation (from circle towards increasingly elongated ellipse, and irregular concave polygon), the method (3) recognizes non-elongated but highly irregular shapes as highly elongated shapes (Fig. 8 a). Application to a real data set (Fig. 8 b) demonstrates that method (2) effectively distinguishes highly elongated, while method (4) is more efficient in distinguishing among sub-circular shapes. Method (1) gives results similar to method (2), but the irregularity of doline perimeter is in some cases causing false deviations in doline elongation.

and (4)), that generalize the irregular planar shape of a doline express its elongation with fewer errors. Due to mainly sub-circular doline planar shapes, the numerical eccentricity . as a measure of ellipse elongation calculated for the best fitting ellipse (4) appears to be the most efficient method for determination of doline elongation. Spatial representation of a suggested variant of elongation index is presented on a real dataset of 110 dolines (Fig. 9).
ASYMMETRY
The newly generated method for quantitative determination of the degree and the direction of asymmetry was applied to the entire sample of 110 dolines (Fig. 10). Inaccuracy in the direction of asymmetry appears in cases where the shape of a doline is approaching sub-equilateral triangle (dolines 41, 54, 60, 97) or sub-square shapes (doline 64) with several axes of symmetry. 
 CONCLUSIONS
The exact extent of the spatial influence of dolines in karst systems is an ongoing topic of research in karstology and is not an issue specifically dealt with here. However, attention was given to the apparently loose and inconsistent doline delineation methods and morphometric analyses applied so far. Conclusions can be summed up in the following points:
Manual delineation using orthophotos is proven to afford a more reliable method for doline delineation than topographic maps and other automated and semi-automated methods using DEMs of any resolution. 
Contour-based methods (topographical maps and common procedures for doline upper rim extraction from DEM) are not convenient representation of actual doline upper rim due to the vertical irregularity of doline rim and, in case of topographical maps, due to contour interval that may not capture actual doline perimeter.
In order to direct morphometric studies of dolines toward optimization and comparability on wider scales, a mathematical examination of several commonly used ground plan morphometric parameters was undertaken. Simulations demonstrated that employed mathematical approaches own different ranges of validity.
For the purpose of describing the circularity of sub-circular planar shapes of dolines the circumference of a circumscribed circle/the perimeter of the doline is the most effective index of circularity. For determining doline elongation, the optimal method is the numerical eccentricity . of the best-fitting ellipse.
The degree and direction of asymmetry can be satisfactorily described by the distance between the centroid of the largest inscribed circle and the centroid of the doline ground plan.
After examination of some basic principles of doline upper rim determination, and a review of approaches analyzing the planar shape of dolines presented here, the potential significance of parameters as circularity, elongation and asymmetry could finally be established. The uniform employment of adequate parameters and improved delineation methods would lead to greater accuracy and global comparability of doline morphometric data and promises more stable correlations between forms and processes on karst.
