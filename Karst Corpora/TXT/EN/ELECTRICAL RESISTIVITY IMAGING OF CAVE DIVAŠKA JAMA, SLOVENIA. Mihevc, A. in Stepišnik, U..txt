                     Abstract:     Electrical resistivity imaging is a widely used tool in geophysical surveys for 
                     investigation of various subsurface structures. To assess its applicability for subsurface 
                     karst, electrical resistivity imaging was conducted in the southeastern part of the karst 
                     plateau above Divasˇka jama and its sediment-filled denuded continuation on the surface. 
                     Cave    passages    that   are  not   filled  with   sediment     were   not   detected    with   electrical 
                     resistivity imaging, because the electrical resistivity difference between voids and highly 
                     resistive carbonate bedrock is small. On the other hand, denuded caves and cave sections 
                     that   are  filled  with   loamy    material    can   be  clearly   distinguished     from   less  resistive 
                     carbonate bedrock.
