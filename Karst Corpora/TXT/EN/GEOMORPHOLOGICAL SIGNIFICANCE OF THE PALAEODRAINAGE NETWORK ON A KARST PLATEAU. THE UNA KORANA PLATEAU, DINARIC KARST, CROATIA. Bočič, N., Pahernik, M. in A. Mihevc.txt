during  the  Miocene,  while  Pavelić  (2002) claimed  that  during  the 
Miocene this area was probably part of Paratethys. The existence of 
the Neogene Dinaric Lake System in this area has also been described 
by  Harzhauser and Mandić  (2008), Krstić et al. (2012) and Mandić 
et al. (2012). 
    Following the gradual regression of these lakes, it was possible for a 
surface drainage network to develop. Considering the small relief one 
can assume low hydraulic gradients for the entire plateau area. This is 
probably the main cause of the development of the surface drainage 
network     in  the  carbonate     surface.   The   presence    of  impermeable 
Neogene sediments on the surface of the plateau probably contributed 
to the retention of the drainage network. 
    The surface drainage network drained water from the area of the 
present day Una–Korana plateau to the north and northeast towards 
the Pannonian basin, i.e. Pannonian Lake (Magyar et al., 1999). The 
level of the southwestern part of the Pannonian basin represented an 
erosional base level for the majority of the Una–Korana plateau. 
    Neotectonics played a signiﬁcant role in the development of the 
relief of the area. The uplifting of the Dinarides and down-throwing 
of  the  Pannonian  basin  are  characteristic  of  this  neotectonic  stage. 
Areas of the Una–Korana plateau belong to the transitional zone with 
lower amplitudes of vertical movement (Prelogović, 1975). This also 
likely led to the preservation and slower destruction of traces of the 
surface drainage network. Structural and geological researches suggest 
that  there  was  a  transpression  regime  and  inversion  of  the  former 
depression  of  the  Pannonian  basin  during  the  Pliocene  (Prelogović 
et al., 1998; Tomljenović and Csontos, 2001), though a stronger relative 
uplifting of the Una–Korana plateau in relation to the southwestern 
edge of the Pannonian basin likely occurred at the transition between 
the Pliocene and Pleistocene (Kranjec and Prelogović, 1974; Prelogović, 
1975). This increased the hydraulic gradient for watercourses in the 
Una–Korana plateau and inﬂuenced the further development of the relief 
on the Una–Korana plateau during the Pleistocene. 
    Under the inﬂuence of this increased hydraulic gradient, the main 
watercourses began to entrench (Fig. 8A–C), creating canyons (Roglić, 
1964), and also resulted in stronger denudation of the Miocene and 
Pliocene impermeable cover. Due to the sufﬁcient erosion strength of 
the  main    watercourses,     through     down-cutting      they  succeeded      in 
following the increased hydraulic gradient so that a lowering of the 
water level underground still allowed for water  ﬂow at the surface 
(Hevesi, 2001). Initially, the higher ﬂows followed these changes and 
created    the  canyons.    Over   time,   many  streams      lost  their  erosion 
strength and could no longer follow the incision rate of the main water- 
courses. Their thalwegs remained higher than the main watercourse, 
thus forming the hanging valleys. Due to this, they remained above                        Fig. 8. The relationship between processes of karstiﬁcation and destruction of surface
