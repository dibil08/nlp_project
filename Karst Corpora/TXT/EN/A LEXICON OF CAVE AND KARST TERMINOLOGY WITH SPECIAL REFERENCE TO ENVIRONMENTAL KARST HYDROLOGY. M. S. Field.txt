         Release of the first edition of this lexicon was well received and resulted in two printings.  The  

first edition is again in short supply, but rather than going through a third printing, an updated edition  

was deemed appropriate.  Since the release of the first edition, additional definitions related to  

biospeleology, courtesy of Dr. William R. Elliott of the Natural History Division of the Missouri  

Department of Conservation, have been added.  Additional definitions obtained from the Australian  

Speleological Federation also have been added.  

         Researchers and the general public alike will find these additions useful as they work their way  

through the published literature.  For this second edition, the literature search is current to 2002. To be  

sure, this updated lexicon is far from complete and will more than likely be updated in a few years.

                                PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION  

        The National Center for Environmental Assessment–Washington Office (NCEA–W) has  

prepared this document for the benefit of the regional offices and public in general due to the need to  

understand the terminology common to the field of karst.  It is a glossary of most terms that have  

some relationship to the field of environmental karst as well as specific karst terms.  It includes many  

foreign terms because much of the karst research is conducted in foreign countries and published  

using local terminology.  In many instances, common environmental terms are defined in such a way  

as to specifically reference karstic phenomena.  

        The purpose of this document is to serve as a technical guide to regional offices and the public  

in general who must read the karst literature or who must hold discussions with karst researchers.  It is  

intended that this document remove much of the confusion surrounding many of the karst terms.  

        The literature search supporting this lexicon is current to 1998.

                                              INTRODUCTION  

        Several attempts to classify karst terminology in an organized manner have been attempted in  

the past.  The last few glossaries of karst terminology were organized in the late 1960s and published  

in the early 1970s.  Since that time, many new terms related to karst in general have come into use  

throughout the world while other older karst terms are seldom used nowadays.  In the mid 1990s the  

British Cave Research Association (BCRA) published and updated a dictionary that covers the general  

area of karst and caves, but did not focus on environmental issues.  

        Many of the more recent karst terms are related to the upsurge in environmentalism and the  

recognition among karst cognoscenti that karst terranes are much more sensitive to man-induced  

effects on the environment than are other types of landscapes.  In an attempt to be as broad as possible  

in this glossary, terms related to general hydrology and hydrogeology, common karst rock and mineral  

types, and many of the descriptive terms used in speleology even where they relate to specific  

localities, have been included.  No attempt was made to exclude foreign karst terms although many  

are no doubt, missing.  This has led to a much larger manuscript than was originally intended when  

this project was initiated, but it has provided for a more comprehensive document.  

        Because many non-karst professionals, whether working on basic research or on  

environmental problems, need to have a general working knowledge of karst terminology, this  

glossary was developed to provide an up-to-date reference for more modern definitions of karst terms  

both currently in usage and now defunct.  As with any undertaking of this sort, numerous omissions  

will be shown to be evident.  In other instances, disagreements regarding definitions will arise.  In the  

event that readers of this glossary find various omissions or incorrect definitions, it would be greatly  

appreciated if the necessary corrections be forwarded to the author so that the glossary may be updated  

in the future.  

        As a final note, it should be pointed out that a list of references for the definitions are included  

at the back of this glossary and citations are provided when appropriate.  In many instances,  

duplication of definitions from previous glossaries were employed to avoid changing the original  

definitions.  However, efforts were not always attempted to cite the exact source for each definition as  

this would have greatly lengthened this already excessively long manuscript; secondary citations have  

                                                        1  

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

been provided.    Exact citations would also have resulted in confusion where several definitions were  

utilized in the writing of a single clear definition for any particular term.  In no instance was it  

intended that the work of others be appropriated, only that this glossary be as comprehensive and clear  

as possible while avoiding excessive clutter.  Also, where definitions were deemed to be incorrect or  

poorly worded, alternatives have been written.
