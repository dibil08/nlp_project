Preface to the German Edition 
The present publication on karst hydrology and physical speleology combines two subjects which have up to now been treated separately. The two fields of knowledge have gone their separate ways, less as a result of differences in subject matter than of varying approaches. The focal point in karst hydrology lies in the description of subter- ranean water with its physical and chemical properties, whereas physical speleology de- scribes subterranean cavities with their contents (air, water, and sediments), which gen- erally have been created by water. Such cavities can be correctly interpreted only by means of a knowledge of karst hydrology, yet they in turn yield indications of the pro- perties of karst water. Karst hydrology and physical speleology are thus two aspects of the subterranean karst phenomenon and should be viewed congruently. 
This book addresses geologists, hydrologists, geomorphologists, geographers, and karstologists, above all speleologists, as well as all friends of caves, especially the cavers among them. Its contents must therefore appeal to two groups: on one hand to the academically trained, whether university faculty, graduates, or students, who as a rule have the necessary basic knowledge to be able to understand the theoretical com- ments; on the other hand to the laymen, who have fust-hand experience from their own observations in caves, but who often do not dispose over the scientific foundation necessary for an understanding of the phenomena. Therefore occasionally more attention will be given to problems of a simpler nature and to questions of technical terminology. 
During geomorphological studies in the Muota Valley in 1946 it became necessary to investigate the effects of limestone corrosion underground. I then penetrated the H6lloch Cave for the first time. (The H6lloch, Hell Hole, is located in the Muota Valley in Central Switzerland.) Very soon a contrast became apparent between the then predominant notion about subterranean water in karst areas as founded by O. Lehmann and the facts in the H611och. Especially the passages which also showed up on the bedding planes in the commercial cave section matched the theory very poorly, and this weighed even more heavily, as Lehmann's hypothesis was founded on accept- ed physical principles. Furthermore there were additional observations which put his hypothesis equally in question. These contrasts between theory and reality challenged me increasingly into the underground of the karst. There I had to recognize, even though after long resistance, that nature had gone ways which could by no means be explained by the then accepted hypothesis. The goal of solving this problem enticed me to intensify my work and soon the idea of a book arose. The book was to grow out of the natural facts of karst hydrography and to do justice to the evolution of subterranean water passages and thereby to speleology. The necessity of having also to learn about the karst underground 'in differently structured landscapes took me into

many other caves, above all in table-land and arid zones. For both types the USA offered excellent and easily accessible examples, the exploration of which is in full swing, giving rise to valuable publications. 
The Holloch, which happens to lie in my personal geomorphological area of study, became an important element of this book. In 19464280 m of this cave system had been surveyed and were well known. Today, 1980, there are 140000 m. Between 1904 and 1946 all research on it was suspended and all known facts were based on a disser- tation by Egli (1904). The new thrust into virgin areas occurred fIrst in 1948/49 by a research group from the Swiss Society of Speleologists (SSS) and by a precursor of the Association for the Exploration of the Holloch (AGH) which I joined. In August 1952 three collaborators and I were trapped in the cave by rising water. This brought me into especially intensive contact with karst hydrology and gave further impetus to my study of this phenomenon. 
In 1974 Karsthydroge%gie by J. ZotI was published. It brought substantial progress to the understanding of karst water. For the first time it was shown with all desirability that the hypothesis of O. Lehmann was untenable. Thus the spell was broken which had blocked progress for a long time, but which, however, had also stirred up contradiction and thus encouraged new research. 
It is in the nature of karst hydrology and of speleology that they comprise a broad spectrum of supporting sciences. Apart from the geosciences, among them mineralogy, geology, and geomorphology, particularly hydromechanics and the chemistry of the CaC03-COz-H20 system are of central signifIcance. The necessity of a unifIed approach to subterranean karst prompted me to risk the disadvantages against the advantages of a presentation of the whole scope of material by one single author. Prof. M. Frey, to whom I am indebted, assisted me with hydrodynamics. 
Research in subterranean karst is always teamwork. The scientist depends on the assistance of the cavers, whether this is in a purely physical sense or in research by means of surveying, gathering material and observations, or of contributions to dis- cussions. For this reason lowe gratitude to the AGH and its members, my colleagues and friends. The few who are mentioned here stand for the more than 100 collabora- tors who have helped in the course of three decades: H. Ntinlist, the man of the fIrst thrusts, technical director of the AGH during the fIrst decade of exploration; B. Bart- schi, untiring helper and organiser since 1960; D. Kramer, who lost his young life in the exploration. I should like to thank the many friends all over the world, east and west, for reprints, for their permission to use sketches and fmdings from their fIeld of work, for inspiring and fruitful discussions and for numerous guided trips through "their" caves. Of these I should expecially like to mention the members of the Cave Research Foundation, CRF, most particularly R. Brucker. They always received me in the USA with open arms and I am grateful to them for new knowledge and deep in- sight into North American karst hydrology. My thanks go also to the authorities of Mammoth Cave and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks for always granting me permis- sion to enter the great caves and thereby actively supporting my undertaking. Assistants at the Geographical Institute of the University of Zurich helped in the last phase of the realization of this book by copying, sketching, and proof-reading, among them U. Gro- ner and P. Frehner.

To conclude this preface I should like to express my thanks to the publishers, especially to Dr. K.F. Springer for the good layout and presentation of the book, and to Mrs. A. Seeliger for her agreeable co-operation.

1 Karstifiable Rocks 
1.1 Introduction 
The formation of karst landscapes and karst hydrography is related to the occurrence of specific rocks. These must be soluble and may leave but little residue, so that the in- terstices widened by the processes of solution remain open, which is a prerequisite for the characteristic underground drainage. 
The following groups of rocks are karstifiable: 
evaporites: gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt carbonate rocks: limestone, dolomite quartzite: only under conditions of extreme tropic humidity. 
Silicate rocks are known to be nonkarstifiable even though in the humid tropics forms occur which resemble karst forms. In the humid, tropical climate they show a "solubil- ity" which should rather be called a readiness to decompose. It is not the case, as it is with karst rocks, that individual mineral components are dissolved, but that the miner- als themselves are diSintegrated, destroyed - they are weathered. Large amounts of in- soluble residues are thereby created, e.g., clays and perhaps quartz sand. For this rea- son joints within the rock do not widen; at most, existing open joints are made tight, and as a result there is no underground drainage of the karst type. The forms remain limited to the surface. 
Quartzites are a special case. Up to now they have not been listed as karstifiable rocks - in certain cases this has been incorrect, as remains to be shown. According to Krauskopf (1956) and Siever (1962), amorphous silicic acid is soluble, 50-80 ppm at O°C, 100-140 ppm at 25°C - only 6-14 ppm of quartz dissolve at 25°C. For the first time in literature White (1960) reported a "quartzite karst" in the Roraima Formation of the Guayana Shield in southeast Venezuela with karren, even karreri fields, dolines, and enlarged joints. In a small cave he found silicic stalactites. Colvee (1973) describes the 395-m-Iong quartzite cave in the Sierra Autana in the same area, which can have been created only by corrosion. Urbani, the driving force behind karst research in Ve- nezuela, and Szczerban (1974), as well as Szczerban and Urbani (1974), made a thor- ough study of quartzite karst, especially of subterranean quartzite karst. They report shafts, one of them with a depth of 370 m, and a 800-m-Iong cave river with ponor and resurgence (karst spring, re-exit). Precambrian quartzite (age 1700-1800 million years Gassner, 1974) consists, according to White (1960) and White et al. (1966), of rounded grains of quartz in a silicic acid matrix, sporadically mixed with up to 5% feld- spar. The quartz is partially transfo¥fled into amorphous silicic acid (opal), which ex- plains its high solubility. The processes of transformation and dissolution caused by pre- 
2 Karstifiable Rocks 
cipitation are, however, extremely slow and a matter of geological epochs. Therefore Urbani et al. (1976) expressed the supposition that the quartzite matrix, e.g., opal, had been mobilized by the thermal water as a result of granite intrusions and that the rock had thereby been loosened. Afterwards the cavities were hollowed out by erosion along joints and bedding interstices. Seen from a distance, however, the question arises as to why the grains of quartz did not make tight the open joints analogous to the fme dolo- mitic sand in Yugoslavian dolomites. The result would be a lack of karstification. Con- clusion: quartzites, and this means orthoquartzite as well as quartzitic sandstone, are only conditionally karstifiable under hydrothermal but also under extremely humid tropical conditions which remain the same for millions of years. Therefore quartzites will not be further discussed as too little is known about their capacity to karstify. 
1.2 Evaporites 
Under the conditions found in lagoons in warm, dry climates, the subtropics and mar- ginal regions of the tropics, sea water evaporates. According to the composition and the solubility of the components evaporites are deposited: limestone, gypsum, anhydrite, rock and potash salt. According to Clarke (1924) sea water contains twenty times more Ca-sulfates (anhydrite ions) than limestone ions. Therefore as a rule limestone occurs only as a component of other evaporites. Potassium salt (KCI) does not come into ques- tion for a karst landscape because of its small, original concentration ofK-ions, of the high solubility of all other potassium salts, and their high plasticity, as well as because of their rarity. 
1.2.1 Anhydrite and Gypsum 
As corresponds to their creation in lagoons on the surface of the earth, anhydrite, CaS04, and gypsum, CaS04: 2H20, occur far more rarely than limestones and dolomites, which are found around the world. They were deposited in large quantities mainly in the Permian, Triassic, and Tertiary Periods. The following are a few of the numerous regions where useful fmds have been made: in Germany gypsum in the Muschelkalk (middle Triassic) of western WUrttemberg, in the Zechstein (upper Permian) of the southern Harz and around Segeberg, in the USSR in Podolia, in the USA in western Oklahoma and northern Texas, as well as in the Pecos Valley and in the White Sands (gypsum dunes) of New Mexico. The deposits in the USA and in the USSR surpass those of all other known regions in their size and quantity (see also Herak imd Stringfield, 1972). In nature Ca-sulphate is deposited by freshwater only in the form of gypsum, since the lack of greater concentrations of other salts prevents anhydrite from fOrming at temperatures lower than 90°C. In concentrated sea water in the evaporating basins of lagoons anhydrite is formed primarily already at 25°C. If anhydrite comes into con- tact with fresh water, it joins with two molecules of crystal water and turns into gyp- sum. This process results in an increase in volume of 1.557 times (Biese, 1931). This causes the layers to be compressed and gypsum with a wavy structure is formed. On the 
Rock Salt, Halite 3 
earth's surface local gypsum banks are pressed up by the swelling of anhydrite and small cavities are formed beneath,e.g., the Zwerg10cher (Dwarf Holes) and the Waldschmiede (Forest Forge) in the southern Harz. The floor of the Waldschmiede, the largest such form, has a diameter of 7.5 m, while the height of its dome is 2 m. Biese (1931) calls such cavities swelling caves, but does not list them as karst formations as they were not created by karstifying processes. 
Gypsum, the product of a transformation of anhydrite, is very jointed and tends for this reason and because of its high solubility to the formation of caves. The same qualities and in addition its softness, however, lead to its quick destruction. Smaller so- lution forms, especially gypsum karren, are easily destroyed again. However, wherever gypsum has been deposited directly and has been recrystallized, it is massive and only slightly jointed or not at all. 
Underground solution effects a slow sinking of the capping rock (subsidence). On the surface subsidence zones form with solution subsidence dolines and/or atypical karstic troughs. Reuter (1973) measured rates of sinkage as high as 40 cm/y. Occasion- ally covering layers and loose formations on top break off and plunge into the depths. Such an Erdfall is to be classed as a collapse doline. Recently in the DDR land sinking has been observed in areas of larger settlements on top of gypsum and salt deposites. The cause was found to be water seeping in at various distinct points and dissolving the underground. The buildings were damaged. 
Gypsum is frequently made impure to a high degree by clay. In underground cavi- ties a coating of clay is the rule. This, however, does not hinder the dissolution of the rock.

Rock salt (halite), NaCl, is a coarsely crystalline rock of high solubility. Under pressure it becomes highly plastic, which leads to the formation of diapirs (salt dome). For this reason open cracks are lacking. Natural salt caves from inside salt domes are not known, either because underground cavities are not formed at all, or because they are quickly destroyed again after their formation. In the 2500-year-old Iron Age salt mine of Hall- statt (Hallstatt Culture), the old adits have disappeared and the only witnesses left are the well-preserved remains of mining tools. In contrast to this the adits in the salt mine gf Wieliczka (poland) dating from the 18th century have hardly been touched by this phenomenon.

4 Karstifiable Rocks 
As is the case with gypsum, subsidence is frequent, but results even more quickly. Land sinkage is frequent above salt deposits which are exploited with extraction by wa- ter. The exploitation of salt brine had to be halted under the suburbs of Rheinfelden (Switzerland) because the houses were in danger. In humid climates rock salt cannot remain on the surface. Precipitations dissolve it and the residue, a thick mixture of clay and gypsum, protects the deposit from further washing away. In completely arid zones, on the other hand, rock salt is found on the surface also, as salt karst, e.g., in Iran, Abys- sinia, and in Death Valley (CA, USA). Salt karren are pointed and sharp and can scarce- ly be walked on, e.g., the Devil's Golf Course in Death Valley. 
1.3 Carbonate Rocks: Limestone and Dolomite 
1.3.1 Limestone and Dolomite 
Limestone and dolomite are carbonate rocks which have very similar karst morphologi- cal properties.

When sea water is confmed in warm, dry climates, first limestone is formed, but not dolomite, although the Mg-ions are three times more frequent than the Ca-ions (Ca2+). Dolomite is formed afterwards when the Mg2+ substitutes the Ca2+ in the calcite crys- tal until an ion ratio of 1: 1 is reached.

When there is a higher concen tration of sal t water in lagoons dolomite can be deposited spontaneously. Strachowet al. (1944, quoted by Fischer, 1961) observed in the Caspian

Sea, in Kara Bugas (bay on the east side of the Caspian Sea) that when the salt concen- tration was less than 7% only limestone was deposited, when 7%-8% dolomite was spon- taneously deposited, and when the concentration was higher magnesite, MgC03, was deposited. Seidel (1958) assumes that the following reaction takes place: 
It would be more correct to write the reaction as an ion equation: 
Mg2+ + Ca2+ + 2 HCOl" + 2 Cl- -+ CaMg(C03h + 2 Cl- + 2 H+ 
Dolomites which are formed spontaneously belong to the evaporites.

1.3.2 Differences Between Limestone and Dolomite 
Limestone and dolomite are very similar, so similar that the nonexpert can scarcely dis- tinguish one from the other. The surest method of distinguishing them without making a chemical analysis is to test the density. With a little practice one can make this test for a preliminary decision in the field. Dolomite can be distinguished from anhydrite, which is as dense and hard as dolomite, by its reaction in hot hydrochloric acid: it bub- bles up.

Special properties of dolomite which are not generally valid: certain dolomites are destroyed by weathering, breaking down into dolomite sand, e.g., in the Swabian-Fran- conian Jura; they are in general less resistant to frost than is limestone, thus large slopes of dolomite debris can be found (South Tyrolean Dolomites). 
When limestone is mentioned hereafter dolomite will be included in that category. Wherever their properties differ special mention will be made of that difference. For in- stance dolomite in Yugoslavia is, in comparison to limestone, practically impermeable, because dolomite sand makes the interstices tight; in France underground water from dolomite is frequently heavily laden with dolomite sand. 
Limestones 7 
1.3.3 Limestones 
Most limestones are of marine origin, but there are also freshwater and terrestiallime- stones such as calcarenites from the sands of dunes of western Australia. 
According to Clarke (1924) 500-1000 million tons of Ca-salts (sulfates and carbon- ates) are carried to the sea annually. These are deposited as limestone mainly on the con- tinental shelves, but also as far down as in the bathyal zone (at a depth of 200-2000 m). In the abyssal plains it is found as globigerina ooze down to a depth of 5000 m (Mur- awski, 1963). 
Limestone has been deposited partly detritically as gravel, sand and mud (fluvial, surf), pardy by chemical deposition and partly organically (foraminifera, brachiopods, reefs etc.). 
Chalk is a soft, friable, very porous limestone, consisting mainly of foraminifera. In a dry state its density varies between 1.6 and 2.0 kg! dm3 . Its great susceptibility to weathering and to any form of erosion causes karst forms to be destroyed as fast as they form. Therefore karren do not exist at all with the exception of solution pockets, which are related to them, There are isolated doline fields in chalk limestone such as in Picardy (plateau of Baumetz). On the other hand there are frequent karst dry valleys which are of periglacial origin both in northern France and in southern England (Tricart, 1949; Pinchemel, 1954). Caves do occur rarely, e.g., near Rouen, Caumont caves (Avias, 1972). Underground drainage is developed to a medium degree and occasionally shows ponors and karst springs, also (Avre river in Normandy). 
Karst landscapes occur on pure and compact limestones and dolomites. However, limestones are frequently encumbered with impurities, which reduce their ability to karstify or. prevent them from karstification altogether. The two most common insol- uble impurities are clay and silicic acid (opal, flint, quartz).

If the silicic acid is fmely distributed, e.g., in the Hauterivien siliceous limestone of the Helvetian nappes (Swiss Alps, Eastern Alps), karstification is completely prevented by it. If, however, it is concentrated in lumps and nodules of chert which are embedded in a pure limestone matrix, .then karstification takes place according to the matrix. In one of the largest systems of caves in the USA, in Green Brier Caverns (WV, USA), there are many passages running through Paleozoic limestone with innumerable chert nodules and in Speak-Easy Cave near Springfield (MO, USA) lumps almost the size of a head stretch up out of the heavily corroded limestone of the Mississippian. Siliceous pebbles in Lower Tertiary limestone conglomerate on Mallorca do not at all prevent the devel- opment of rillenkarren (solution fiutes), which are otherwise very sensitive to impurities.

1.3.4 Structure of Limestones 
In petrography structure means the spatial arrangement and distribution of equal ele- ments in rock. The English school especially attributes great importance to structure in the formation of limestone surfaces. Sweeting (1972, 1975), Oxford, is investigating this relationship. 
Coarse crystalline limestones show less clear karst forms than do fine crystalline ones; thus karren are only poorly formed in the pure marble of the Apuanic Alps. Coarse crystalline parts in a fme crystalline matrix and calcite-filled tension cracks dissolve less easily and therefore project up above the limestone surface. The finer the grain, the larger the surface vulnerable to corrosion. 
English literature has taken over the division according to Folk (1959) for petrol- geological investigations by karsuesearchers (Jennings, 1971; Sweeting, 1972). His the- 
Permeability of Limestone Rock 9 
ory is based on the fact that limestone mud is deposited in quiet, shallow seas. The re- sulting limestones he calls micrites since their basic mass is micro- to crypto-<:rystalline. The matrix appears gray in the microscope. If its deposits are disturbed by submarine slides or ploughing shellfish he speaks of dismicrites. The allochems, the parts brought in from the exterior, are embedded in this matrix. Detritic allochems are called intra- clasts. They vary from the size of a fine grain of sand to that of pebbles. Ooliths, pellets (calcite particles of organic origin) and organisms (foraminifera, corals, brachiopods, molluscs, sponge needles, etc.) are further examples. The result is the following rock schema: 
micrite 
_____ intramicrite ::::::::::-- oomicri te ~ peimicrite biomicrite 
If the matrix consists of clearly distinguishable calcite crystals, its cleavability be- comes obvious. This attribute is called spar. From spar Folk took the term sparite. The same terminology is valid here as with the micrites: 
___ intrasparite spar! 't e::::::--- ---====::: ~ oosparite pelspante . biosparite 
Sparites develop where cavities or large pores were already in existence primarily, or where limestone mud was washed away from between the allochems by water in mo- tion, so that calcite crystals could develop in the spaces. There are, however, also aut- ochthonous limestones, limestones which were already deposited on the site, e.g., reefs (coral, sponge and algae reefs). To these Folk applies the term bioliths, which Potonie (1905) initiated. As a consequence bioherm will be used in this work for reefs which tower up and biostrom for small flat reefs. Further differentiation will not be attempt- ed. 
1.3.5 Permeability of Limestone Rock 
Three factors determine the permeability of carbonate rocks, their porosity, their joint- ing, and their bedding. Of these three the jointing especially is of great importance for karst morphology as well as for karst hydrology (see Chap. 14.1). The joints influence not only the appearance of the surface (grikes, bogaz, rows of dolines, directed karst), but also the underground water systems which, under vadose conditions, can come into existence only through joints which have opened. In the phreatic zone the water sys- tems lie mainly in the bedding-planes. Joints are important also because they stand more or less vertically on bedding-planes, connecting them. 
Bedding-planes occur in limestones in capillary to subcapillary widths. Their per- meability is increased if they have served for tectonic movements; then they bear simi-

larity to faults. Caves in folded mountains illustrate this. In H6lloch 90% of the 140 kIn of measured passages are bedding-plane controlled. However, this does not preclude that jointing also plays a part in it. Bedding planes have the advantage of being connect- ed over long distances without interruption. Bedding planes are of special importance when they separate a capping limestone bed from the underlying, impermeable rock, e.g., from slate. The water courses form in the limestone and then, after they reach a certain size, they cut down, by means of erosion, into the softer, underlying rock. Fre- quently cave rivers follow those bedding planes. Compact carbonate rocks are practical- ly impermeable to water. Since they are also brittle, even slight tectonic stress leads to the formation of joints, e.g., even in the tectonic domes in Tennessee and Ohio. On their flanks enormous caves have developed, among them the longest in the world, the Flint Mammoth Cave system. By virtue of the corrosive widening of jointings limestone be- comes the most permeable rock; moreover a rock in which permeability increases with time. Not alljoints show the same properties. The main system of joints usually has clos- ed pressure joints, standing perpendicular to the direction of pressure, and tension joints which are sometimes open. In such one can often fmd a permeable breccia, which is either still loose or consolidated by calcite. It can easily be attacked by water and clear- ed away. Porous limestones are permeable, even if only to a slight degree when compar- ed to jointed limestone. Under a pressure head water flows slowly through the pores. This primary permeability is not so very dependent on the volume of the pores as on their width and the connections between them. Thus a sandstone with half the volume of pores that a marly clay has is nevertheless around 1000 times more permeable.

Reef-forming organisms, corals, sponges, algae, build up unbedded limestone masses which can become dolomitized with time. They are called Massenkalke in Germany. Reef sands form slopes around such reefs. The sands become hardened to calcarenites with a primary bedding incline of up to 20° and 30°, e.g., the sponge reefs of the Swa-

bian Jura. Such bioherms enclose only a delimited area and are completely local. In contrast to single reefs, atolls embrace a small, barrier reefs a great extent. The Austra- lian barrier reef is 1800 Ian long. Such reefs, originating in the Paleozoic Era, have been geologically and karst-morphologically studied in detail; e.g., the Permian Capitan- Reef in the Guadlllupe Ridge near Carlsbad (NM, USA; Newell et al., 1953; Motts, 1972) and the Devonian reef ofthe Napier Range in West Kimberley, Australia (Jennings and Sweeting, 1963; Playford and Lowry, 1966). The forereef facies correspond to those surrounding single reefs: calcarenites. The reeflimestones themselves are dolomitic and unbedded. Interpolated calcarenitic nests give evidence of former reef caverns which ftl- led up with reef sand. In the backreef zone where the surf becomes calm again calcare- nites form which gradually tum into well-banked micrites with interpolated bioherms and biostroms. If it is a barrier reef, the content of impurities increases as it approaches the mainland. 
The two examples of barrier reefs mentioned have essential differences in their karstification: the Napier Range shows surface karst with few small caves, the Guada- lupe Ridge shows slight surface karstification but has, on the other hand, spacious caves such as the Carlsbad Caverns. 
2 Processes of Dissolution of Karstifiable Rocks, 
Corrosion 
Corrosion, used in the geomorphological sense, is the dissolution of rocks. The tenn chemical erosion, which used to be applied to this phenomenon, is too narrow and causes confusion because it inadequately expresses the basic processes. Today it is rarely used anymore. 
There are three types of corrosion: a) The corrosion of carbenate rocks is a reversible chemical reaction (French: cor- rosion, Gennan: Korrosion), which gives rise to the fonnation of carbonate karst in rel- atively pure limestones and dolomites. 
b) The corrosion of gypsum and rock salt is a reversible physical process (French: dissolution, Gennan: Korrosion) which results in gypsum or salt karst. 
c) In warm, humid climates irreversible chemical processes take place in silicate rocks, that is a decomposition of rock-fonning minerals. The results are partly soluble products, e.g., salts of Na +, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and partly insoluble ones such as SiOrgel (silicic acid), clays, and quartz sand as an unchanged residue. These are purely processes of weathering. The fonns which are thereby created can be similar to those of karst (pseudokarst), e.g., pseudorinnenkarren, or they can take on their own shapes like the tafonis (Klaer, 1956; Wilhelmy, 1958). The actual processes involved are insufficiently known in detail, but seem to depend on the fact that silicates are unstable in the pre- sence of water with a higher CO2 content and organic acids in such temperatures as pre- vail in the humid tropics (25°-35°C and higher). Even if individual minerals can be re- generated in the resulting soils, it is still impossible to speak of reversibility in the sense of the creation of a rock with at least the same chemical properties as the original had. The rate of dissolution vL is important for all three types. It depends on numerous factors, e.g., on the diffusion coefficient D, the momentary concentration C, the con- centration of saturation Cs' and on the surface A, as well as on exterior conditions, such as the temperature, which detennines the rate of reaction, the removal of the dissolved material from the corroded surface, or on the rate of diffusion, the speed of flow, the turbulence of the water, and the roughness of the rock's surface. The exterior factors are defmed in the constant of proportionality k, which is determined empirically: 
dC vL = dt = k . A . D (C - Cs) (Feitknecht, 1949, p. 163) 
In chemical dissolution chemical reactions enter the picture with the diffusion or con- vection of active substances to the rock's surface, or to a rock component which has al- 
Dissolution of Gypsum and Rock Salt 13 
ready been physically dissolved, e.g., in corrosion of lime where the rate of diffusion of atmospheric CO2 into water is important because it becomes a limiting factor owing to its smallness. 
The dissolution of rock is the decisive process in the formation of karst. Because of the difficulty in determining k, which shows a different value in every new case, vL has till now not been used in geomorphological calculations. k is dependent on temper- ature and therefore vL must be taken into consideration qualitatively as a factor in climamorphology . 
2.1 Dissolution of Gypsum and Rock Salt 
Anhydrite, CaS04, gypsum, CaS04 . 2H20, and rock salt (halite), NaCl, form ionic lat- tices which the ions leave during dissolution without any chemical change: i.e., physical dissolution. When anhydrite, gypsum, or rock salt crystallize, the same crystal lattice forms again. 
Anhydrite and gypsum: Rock salt: caSo4 ~ Ca2+ + SO~­ 
NaCl ~Na++Cl- 
Dissolution occurs in a closed system and approaches continuously in an exponential curve the point of saturation.

The curve of saturation for gypsum reveals a relatively slight dependence on tem- perature. At O°C there are 1.76 g ofCaS04in 1 kg of solution, at 3SoC there are 2.10S g and at 4SoC there are 2.100 g. Thus the curve runs through a maximum. 
Gypsum deposits resulting from the cooling of saturated calcium-sulphate water are not common. The deposits, which are several meters in size, found in the Big Room of Carlsbad Caverns (NM, USA) have been explained in this way (Bretz, 1949; Good, 
14 Processes of Dissolution of Karstifiable Rocks, Corrosion 
1957). As a rule, however, gypsum deposits are the result of the evaporation of water (evaporite). 
The solubility of gypsum is 10 to 30 times greater than that of limestone (Gmelin, 1961). In addition, the rate of dissolution is higher because it is only a matter of the ions' detaching from the crystal lattice.

Gypsum is therefore more exposed to corrosion by precipitation than is limestone. Karren form quickly and without the participation of other substances (priesnitz, 1969). They are sharp and pointed but because of the softness of the rock they are soon de- stroyed again. Caves are in general short, rarely longer than 4 km (HeimkeWe, DDR). This is a result of phYSical dissolution which effects that the water's capacity to dissolve is exhausted after a certain distance of underground flow. There are no reactions which could interrupt the dissolution of gypsum for a defmite time - nor can the concentra- tion be decreased except by the introduction of fresh water capable of dissolving. Among gypsum caves those of Podolia are sole exceptions: Optimisticeskaja Peschtschera with 119 km and Ozem~a Peschtschera with 103 km. There is still little known about the conditions of their formation. They are labyrinths. 
Notable among the corrosion forms in the caves are the horizontal roofs created by dissolution and the facets created during their formation. These present an image of the layering of the water according to its density (Gripp, 1912). Brandt et al. (1976) pursued this problem further and won new insight into this process. Yet Volker (1973) did not exclude the possibility of their creation by erosive denudative processes.

Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks 15 
The dissolution of rock salt proceeds according to the same laws. Yet its solubility is 180 times greater and reaches 360 gil. Its dependence on the temperatures which oc- cur in nature is very slight and practically negligible between 0° and 40°C. 
2.2 Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks 
The dissolution oflimestone and dolomite is the central problem of superficial and un- derground karstification. It takes place in a system of substances of the type CO2 - H20 -MeC03 (Me: Ca or else Mg). It comprises numerous physical and chemical pro- cesses, in which all three aggregate states - gas, liquid, and solid - participate. This causes a mass transfer through the interfaces air/water and water/rock (Fig. 2.4). 
Air -= ~ Water . = -- - ~~ 
Fig. 2.4. 
The processes at the interfaces are physical (mass transfer, diffusion), within the solution they are chemical. 
In the system of substances CO2 - H20 - CaC03 essentially the following steps take place: 
1. During precipitation atmospheric CO2 diffuses into the water:

Fig. 2.5. See text at Eq. (1) 
2. The physically dissolved CO2 is 0.75% hydrated at 4°C (carbonic acid):

The second oxydation level, the dissociation of HC03" into CO~ - and H'", can be neglected at a pH of below 8.5 because of its small proportion. 
4. When water and carbonate rock come into contact the ions are freed out of the crystal lattice, a physical process: 
Fig. 2.8. See text at Eq. (4)

Dissolution of Carbonate Rocks 17 
6. The solution along the interface becomes impoverished of CO~ -. The solution's equilibrium with the solid CaC03 is thereby disturbed and the ion product no longer corresponds to the solubility product L. 
(CaZ+) (CO~ -) = L = 4.0' 10-9 (picknett, 1973) at WOC. 
Note: round brackets ( ... ) mean the "activity" of their content; square brackets [ ... ] point out the concentration (see Chap. 2.2.4). 
The solubility product L has been determined in quite different ways by different authors. Picknett's figures might actually be the most precise. 
Table 2.1. L according to Picknett (1973) 
L: 4.1' 10-9 4.0.10-9 3.9.10-9 3.8· 10-9 3.7. 10-9 
In order to replace the expended CO~ - and thereby bring the ion product again up to the constant L, CaC03 again dissolves (4th step), whereby [Caz+] increasingly predominates over [CO~ -]. 
The equilibrium between the carbonic acid and its first product of dissociation is disturbed by the combination of H + with CO~ - , and renewed dissociation results. In order to maintain the equilibrium physically dissolved COz is hydrated and thereby the equilibrium with atmospheric COz disturbed, which is the reason why new COz dif- fuses into the solution. In short: all the steps in the reaction are re-activated by the as- sociation of H+ and CO~ - until a new equilibrium is reached. Therefore processes of dissolution are not to be comprehended as static only, they must also be considered dynamic. 
By the addition of steps 2-5 the well-known and much-used equation for the disso- lution of limestone is reached (dissolution equation):

If Mg2+ also takes part in the process of dissolution, the conditions on the interface solution/rock become considerably more complicated. To be precise the dissociation of water should also be included: 
However, under natural conditions this ion portion can be neglected as the extreme pH values necessary for a higher portion are not attained in karst. 
2.2.1 CO2 on Either Side of the Interface Air/Solution 
CO2 is the only component in the system which can vary uninterruptedly within wide margins. The most importan t source of CO2 is the air of the atmosphere and of the soil; their CO2 . contents generally make up between 0.00035 and 0.1 of the total pressure (Bagli, 1969a;Miotke, 1972, 1974). Under special conditions the partial pressure p'co 2 sinks below 0.00035, for example with increasing altitude, in forests (aSSimilation) or in close contact with melting snow, limestone, and air (Ek et al., 1969, Bagli, 196ge). A wind with only 0.016% CO2 (Bagli, 1970), as an exception 0.010% CO2, blows at times out of the Schwyzerschacht (Muotatal, Badmerenalp). At present the mean p'co 2 of atmospheric air lie~ at sea level at 0.035% but is frequently higher close to the ground.

The CO2 content of the air in the soil exceeds that of the atmosphere which is 0.035%; values between 10 and 100 times that amount are nonnal. As the upper limit Roques (1962) mentions 10%, i.e., 300 times as much, and Trombe (1952) even 25%, or 700 times as much. In a humus soil at 1650 m above sea level Bagli (1969) measured a peo 2 of 8.3% in relation to 760 mm ofHg; this corresponds to a portion of 10.2% in the soil's air. The CO2 of the soil's air is biogenic since it is created by processes of de- composition of organic substances by organisms in the soil and by root respiration (Bagli, 1960a, Miotke, 1974). 
According to Henry's Law the peo 2 of the atmosphere and the dissolved CO2 are in the following relationship to one another: 
Peo 2 = D . [C02 ], D: diffusion coefficient dependent on temperature (2.1)

By means of Eq. (2.2) the CO2 concentration in the solution is determined when in equilibrium with the Pco of the atmosphere. CO2 is dissolved physically to more 2 than 99%, the remainder, 0.7% at 4°C, is hydrated (Trombe, 1952). When the pco 2 is constant the CO2 content of the water sinks to 37.3% at 30°C, compared with the con- tent at O°C. As a result the solubility of the limestone sinks also.

Little is known concerning the CO2 hydrates. The existence of a hexahydrate, CO2 • 6H20, is certain but according to Roques (1962) nothing can be said about the other hydrates. The kind of hydrate cannot be determined from the dissociation products. Therefore the monohydrate CO2 • H20, or H2C03, is taken as a norm. 
Between the dissolved CO2 and the products of the fIrst step of dissociation there exists an equilibrium with the dissociation constant K 1• 
Kl = ~[H_+~1~[H-:-C_O--,3,-,,-1 
CO~ 
The valuesforKl vary according to the author. Cigna (1972) considers those ofRoques (1964) as the best, while those of Harned and Owen (1958) are preferred in the Anglo- Saxon world (picknett et al., 1976).

I t is clear from the graphs that a pH-value of 8.5 CO2 and CO~ - each make up 1.2% and that the HC03" reaches its maximum of 97.6%. At a pH below 8.3 the content of CO~ - can even be neglected in calculations. The same is true of CO2 at a pH above 8.7. However at 6.6 and below, its concentration even exceeds that of HC03". In nature, where pH values between 6.25 and 8.75 occur, CO~ - is quantitatively of no essential significance. In equilibrium karst water generally shows pH values between 7 (corre- sponding to approx. 330ppm of dissolved limestone) and 8.5 (50 ppm). HC03" strongly dominates here. 
2.2.2 The Kinetics of CO2 
Up to now CO2 and the other members of the system have been looked at under static conditions, which show defmite qualitative and quantitative relationships. If one takes primarily a kinetic point of view - considering the rates of reaction and changes in con- centration in general - one must be satisfied with qualitative statements. Either the models used diverge too greatly from the actual realities of nature or the parameters cannot be detennined sufficiently precisely. The results, calculated theoretically, are at best approximate values. A few clearly defmed cases are an exception, e.g., the changes in concentration during dripping. 
The mass transfer from one medium to another always takes place slowly, which is the reason why an existent state adjusts only gradually to a new one. Changes in the pco, can, on the other hand, take place abruptly, for example when water moves through a tube without contact with air and then issues into a cavity with an open water

surface. In the airless tube the water fonns a closed system in which nothing more changes after the equilibrium is reached: if the lime content is low, no limestone is dis- solved, if it is high, none is deposited. A theoretical Pea, prevails which is in equilibrium with the dissolved CO2. When the pool is reached the system is open and shows a new Pea, to which it must adjust. eq = In equilibrium) Fig. 2.l7pI in is the the closed theoretical system, partial P2 is pressure that in the to the air-filled CO2 in cavity; equilibrium assumed: (C02eq, PI < P2 which for example corresponds to the conditions in bare karst. When the water flows into the air-filled space it is undersaturated in relation to P2. The graph shows an exponential curve where the partial pressure gradually adjusts to the pressure in equilib- rium with the P2 as atmospheric CO2 diffuses into the water. T refers to the time (t) which passes before 90% of the change in concentration necessary for the equilibrium has taken place.

In ascending karst springs (vauclusian springs) nonnally PI > P2. In comparison to the air on the exterior (P2) the water has an excess of CO2 and therefore gives off CO2 to the atmosphere (Fig. 2.18). 
I t has already been mentioned that in both cases the concentrations of the various components are forced to change. 
The transition from one medium into the other is detennined in the case of quiet water by the diffusion coefficient D of the CO2 in the air and in the water. 
Din air = 0.138 cm2s-1 (O°C, 1 atm); 1 cm2s-1 (25°C) Din water = 0.95 . 10-5 cm2s-1 (O°C). 
Because the diffusion coefficient in the water is smaller by the factor 10-4, the rate of diffusion is 10,000 times lower there. The latter therefore determines the amount of the mass transfer through the interfac.e.

If the two media are motionless, the CO2 molecules move on only by diffusion. There is no need to speak of a marginal layer· thereby since the entire volume reflects its conditions. The adjustment to the equilibrium takes place from the interface and progressively includes parts which are more and more distant. It is obvious that the ratio of the surface to the volume, A/V, is the decisive factor for T. 
When the water is turbulent conditions change fundamentally. CO2 is carried away from the interface inunediately by convection and mixed with the solution, as the wa- ter's movement is greater by the power of tens than the rate of diffusion. The whole volume is thereby brought to approximately the same concentration and the difference of the concentration at the interface is always held at the maximum. This greatly ac- celerates mass transfer. Moreover the water surface is rough and the A/V is increased. This has a similar effect. 
One of the best examples that has been investigated is the behavior of CO2 in a sin- ter tube. These stalactites are not rare in caves, measuring between 10 and 100 cm in length - as an exception up to 450 cm - at diameters of between 4 and 6 mm. Roques (1964, 1969a) examined the drops which emerge at the lower end of the tube. Its wall can the water be considered forms a closed airtight system so that with no contact partial CO2 exists pressure with the Pl > air P2. on When the exterior. CO2 is given Thus 
off the Peo. changesfrompl to P2 by way ofp', the concentration Cl thereby changes also by way ofC' to C2, where the equilibrium is reached (Fig. 2.19). 
Whether the equilibrium is reached during the formation of the drop is simply a question of time. T amounts to approx. 4 h. Dixon and Hands (1957, quoted according to Roques, 1964,p. 346/7) investigated the rhythm of drops falling every 0.1-10 s, Ro- ques did the slower ones. 
The occurrence of a minimum of CO2 loss during the formation of a drop seems to be contradictory. If the drop already falls off after 0.1 s, 16% (C l - C2) is given off, after 4 s it is only 9%. When the time of formation is short (0.1 s), the water flowing in quickly, turbulence is great and therefore a maximum difference of concentration to the Peo. in the air dominates practically constantly. When the period of formation is 4 s the turbulence is so low that a marginal layer can build up in which diffusion deter- mines the rate of discharge of CO2. Of course the thickness "d" of this marginal layer

is still slight so that the concentration gradient Cl/C I and therefore also the rate of dif- fusion is high even though the latter still lies far below the velocity of convection. 
As the length of the period of formation of the drop increases the turbulence con- tinues to decrease. Moreover there is a transition of (PI - P2) to (p' - P2), decreasing until approximately zero. The discharge of CO2 sinks thereby, also approachfug zero. 
T is reached in approx. 4 h. From this the order of magnitude of T can be derived for other forms, too. The drop of 0.08 cm3 shows aA/V of 8.9 cm-l, as long as it hangs on the sinter tube as a hemisphere, and of 11.2 cm when it is released as a sphere.

been measured approximately several times in nature. Natural processes, wind, evapora· tion, and temperature changes generally vary this value. 
The period of the formation of the drop ends when it falls off. Dixon and Roques both chose a height of fall of 1 m. They observed that as the period of formation of the drop increased, there was a continuous decrease of 16% from the amount (C l - C2) at a rhythm of 0.1 s to 9% at 4 s and to 2% at 7. At the moment when the drop falls off an approximate sphere forms from the hemisphere and A/V increases abruptly from 8.9 cm- l to 11.2 cm- l . Moreover a short turbulence follows after the detachment of the drop falls. That means there are two further constant magnitudes at the same height of fall. There still remains the turbulence taken over from the drop; it results in an ad- ditional loss of CO2 when the intervals between the drops are short. When the drop strikes and subsequently flows away 70%, 82%, and 7% of the (C l - C2) is given off at drip-intervals of 0.1 s, 4 s, and 4 h respectively. 
2.2.3 Dissolution of CaC03 
The dissolution of carbonates results in the first place from the release of ions from the ionic lattice, Le., the passage of the ions through the interface solid/liquid. It does not happen at any arbitrary rate as the ions are surrounded with H20 molecules (hydra- tion); this is connected with a low energy requirement. In the system CO2 - H20 - CaC0 3 the dissolution of CaC03 belongs to the slow reactions. 
On the surface of the solid substance a marginal layer forms during dissolution which remains intact even wh,en the turbulence is strong. It is several microns thick. In it the movement of ions takes place only by diffusion, which determines the rate of dis- 
Dissolution of CaCOs 29 
solution by its slowness. During turbulence there exists beyond this layer a balanced concentration C t , on the limestone the concentration in equilibrium Ck , which depends on the equilibrium with the H+ brought in by diffusion. Therefore the concentration gradient in the marginal layer amounts to

C ! " ::0 o o Water 
Ca2+ CO~- HCOj H+ CO2 - - - - - When those ions leave the ionic lattice CO~ - is transformed by H+ into HCOi. Ac- cording to Roques (1964) it is irrelevant whether the H+ or the hydronium ion is put in. In the marginal layer there are two directions of movement: Ca2+, CO~ -, and HCOi move towards the zone of turbulence, H+ and CO2 toward the rock. 
The solubility of CaC03 is dependent on the kind of ionic lattice built up by the Ca2+ and CO~ -. Under natural conditions rhomboedric calcite is the most stable modi- fication with the lowest degree of solu bility. Metastable rhombic aragonite is somewhat more soluble. The other two modifications, hexagonal vaterite and the amorphous CaC03-gel are unstable in contact with water and are transformed into calcite, and, when the concentration is suffiCiently high, into aragonite. Here, too, for the degrees of solubility there are different values given in literature. To be sure Cigna (1975) names those of Roques (1964) and Stchouzkoy-Muxart (1972) as the best; the values of Frear and Johnston (1929), whose figures became claSSical, are 20% higher, and also those of Tillmans (1932) show similar divergences, apart from the low CO2 contents below 2 ppm. This causes uncertainty. 
Roques and Stchouzkoy worked with the same experimental arrangement. The former dealt with the area of 10° and 15°C for calcite and aragonite, the latter with that of 20° and 30°C for calcite. The results of both complement one another very well, yet those ofRoques appear to be somewhat too high; this becomes unpleasantly appar- ent only when a curve of dependence on temperature is drawn.

C02eq is always associated with dissolved CaC03. In place ofC02eq the peo z re- sulting from it can also be put in. For a long time Tillmans' empirically gained pairs of values (1932) were valid for calculations. They were subsequently modified by the work of Pia (1953), Roques (1962, 1964) and others and given a theoretical basis, which was, however, Similarly based on empirical figures to a large extent. 
Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO; can be determined precisely and expediently today by means of complexometric methods. One can fmd the pH value with any desired degree of pre- cision. It is closely related to all the components of the system CO2 - H20 - CaC03•

2.2.4 Influence of Other Ions 
In natural solutions of the system CO2 - H20 - CaC03 there are almost always other ions to be found, above all Mg2+, more rarely SO~ - , also alkali ions in the vicinity of the sea and in arid regions with saltwater lakes. In addition ions from mineral springs, weathered rocks and ores, guano, fertilizers, sewage water, and mine water are found locally. Very generally it is true that in the case of a saturated solution of a salt which has a low degree of solubility the addition of a second, more easily soluble salt which has no ion in common with the first increases the solubility of the first. Cigna etal. (1963) proved an increase in the solubility of 10%-25% from the addition of 0.1% NaCl.

Explanation: the activity of the ions is the portion of active ions in the total stock of ions and the activity coefficient f is the factor with which the concentration of ions must be multiplied in order to obtain the activity (Langelier, 1936; Pauling, 1967). Ac- cording to this the activity ofCa2+ is: 
f is always smaller than 1. Everything that hinders the movement of the ions reduces their activity. That is for example "Ule case when the concentration of ions is increased from C to C'. Then the following is true: 
34 Processes of Dissolution of Karstifiable Rocks, Corrosion 
One must thereby take into consideration the interpretation of the solubility product: 
Pure solution: L = (Ca2+) (CO~ -) = [Ca2+] [CO~ -] fCa2+ . fco2 , - . The addition of other ions reduces the activity from f to f'. The product sinks. In order to reach L an additional dissolution of CaC03 is required, i.e., the originally saturated solution becomes undersaturated by the addition of other ions. The solubility of CaC0 3 thereby increases by the corresponding amount. 
Reversely the addition of a substance with one ion the same causes a reduction in the solubility of the limestone because in the solubility product Ca2+ or CO~ - occurs in addition. Therefore the result must be the deposit oflimestone in order to retain the constancy of L. Indeed the activity coefficient sinks at the same time, also, whereby part of this effect is again offset. Roques' experiments (1964) show a remarkable in- crease in solubility with the addition of MgClz. Mg2+ tends to the formation of com- plexes in a solution with HCOi, i.e., to a fIxation in the uncharged MgCO~ complex and in the. MgHCO; complex. The portion of these complexes is of great consequence as opposed to the corresponding Ca complexes which occur only in such slight amounts that they can be neglected. The formation of complexes considerably disturbs the elec- trical equilibrium between Mgz+ and CI-. Therefore Caz+ is drawn upon in substitution which leads to a renewed dissolution of limestone quite apart from the change offCa2+ (see too Garrels et al., 1961). 
Gerstenhauer and Pfeffer (1966) found that the primary MgC03 content of a rock considerably reduces the amount of CaC03 dissolved in the unit of time. Experiments with artifIcially produced mixtures of CaC03 and MgC03 as sediments show a sinking of the amounts of CaC03 dissolved in 28 h from 17 ppm in the case of pure CaC03 to approx. 6 ppm with 2% MgC03 content and to 3 ppm with 95%. This phenomenon presumably plays an important role in karstifIcation. Closer investigations in the fIeld are still lacking.

The calcium carbonate ftrst precipitates out of solution with Mg2+ and Ca2+ as sin- ter tufa, as long as the Mg2+ does not dominate (see Chap. 1.3.1). To test this a small stream with a tufa-bed, a medium gradient of 15% and a water flow of 0.41/s was ex- amined. There were three measurement stations (1,2,3) at distances of80 m (Ml-M2) and 160m (M2"M3). The average velocity of flow between Ml and M2 was 686 m/h, be- tween M2 and M3, 960 m/h and between Ml and M3, 847m/h.

From the table it can be seen that the Mg2+ content rises when the air is dry and evaporation increases accordingly but that when there is slight evaporation it remains unchanged within the frame of the margin of error. The higher Mg values at stations 2 and 3 are a consequence of the solution's loss of water on days oflow humidity. 
2.2.5 Mixing Corrosion (plates 1.3, 1.4) 
Buneyew (1932, quoted from Laptev, 1939) recognized the fact that water in equilib- rium becomes corrosive again when it mixes with other water with a different concen- tration ofCa2+. Laptev(1939) pursues this thought. In Germany KIut (1943) mentions this phenomenon, which can lead to very unpleasant corrosion in drinking water and sewage pipes and in concrete constructions in water. This knowledge remained limited to a small group of water supply anq sewage engineers. In 1961 Bogli discovered the 
36 Processes of Dissolution of Karstifiable Rocks, Corrosion 
phenomenon anew and published his results (1963c, 1964a-c), which were completely concerned with karst and speleology. Ernst (1964) established the theoretical basis for them. Mixing corrosion can be derived from usual corrosion with the aid of the curve of equilibrium. On the convex side lies the water oversaturated with lime, on the concave, the aggressive water with its surplus of CO2 , Any straight line between two arbitrary points of the curve runs through the aggressive zone. Those are the straight lines of mixing in which lie all possible mixtures of the two waters which are in eqUilibrium, W 1 and W 2. The surplus of CO2 created by the mixing can be graphically determined with the aid of the curve of equilibrium.

Mixing Corrosion 37 
It is assumed that the temperature is 15°C. W 1 is water with 10 ppm ofCaC03 and approx. 0.1 ppm ofC02eq. W2 is water with 350 ppm ofCaC03 and 174 ppm ofC02eq (according to Til1mans it was only 101 ppm of CO2). A mixture of such extreme con- tents of lime occurs only rarely in nature, perhaps where bare karst and soil covering with a high degree of biological activity occur side by side, e.g., in the Mediterranean region. The mixture 1: 1 (A) results in a CaC03 content of 180 ppm with 87 ppm of CO2. But this lime content demands only 23 ppm of C02eq (C). Therefore there is a CO2 surplus of 64 ppm (AC). The portion AB is required to dissolve the additional CaC03, BC is used for the increase ofC02eq. According to the equation of dissolution Eq. (2.2) 1 mol of CaC03 requires 1 mol of CO2 for dissolution. Therefore AB is to BD as 1: 1, i.e., 44 ppm of CO2 to 100 ppm ofCaC03 (1 mmol each), see auxiliary graph (left) above. Its angle a is therefore to be used atA to the construction. BD corresponds to the amount of additionally dissolved CaC03, here 65 ppm - a rare extreme in nature. The determination of the aggressivity of a mixture can also be extended to primar- ily aggressive water or to water oversaturated with CaC03 ; see W 1 in mixture with W 3 or W 4 respectively. That with W3 results in an additional dissolution of 62 ppm oflime, yet W 3 shows a primary aggressiveness of 38 ppm so that 24 ppm fall to mixing corro- sion. W 4, oversaturated with lime, when in mixture with W 1, still manages an actual, ad- ditional dissolution of28 ppm ofCaC03 . In the case of an even greater surplus oflime, as Thrailkill (1968, p. 33) established in the groundwater of Kentucky, it is possible that no additional lime can be dissolved at all - the mixture is then accordingly less oversaturated. In nature usually much smaller differences in the lime content occur. In Holloch the extremes are 50 ppm and 200 ppm, which results in 14 ppm of CaC03 as the amount additionally soluble.

These values are somewhat higher than those calculated by Howard (l966) with the figures of Garrels and Christ (1965). Picknett's investigations (1977) showed that when carbonate waters with different Mg contents mix, aggressiveness also increases: rejuvenated aggressiveness.

2.2.6 Cooling Corrosion and Thermal Mixing Corrosion 
With increasing temperature and constant Peo, the solubility of carbonates ofMg, Ca (Sr, Ba) decreases. On one hand the amount of CO2 dissolved sinks (Tables 2.3 and 2.4, Fig. 2.12), on the other hand the required C02eq rises (Fig. 2.24). The values necessary to establish the curves of temperature dependence have not yet been determined exper- imentally in their entirety. Single values do not offer any common result and even Ro- ques' (1964) and Stchouzkoy's (1972) values are not very suitable for this purpose. Therefore the theoretical deduction of Zehender et al. (1956) will be applied here. The values calculated from it by Bogli (1964a) are correct in their magnitude and above all in the type of °C 40 L j:J V V 20 I j I

Whenever the temperature of water in equilibrium sinks CO2 becomes available for the dissolution of limestone: cooling corrosion.

Cooling corrosion is active in the upper, vadose regions of underground karst. It is connected to zones with strong, daily thermal variations or with clearly marked seasons. In the first case it ,is active during the day unti1late in the night, in the second during the warm season. As soon as the temperature above the surface is less than the day's average or the annual average, respectively, cooling corrosion ceases since the temper- ature at a depth of 10-25 m, depending on the kind of rock, corresponds to the annual

mean temperature there. Daily variations are detectable a few decimeters deep in the ground at the most. Below the level of constant temperature the temperature rises anew (geothermal gradient, see Chap. 15.2). 
In mature karst circumstances are basically different. Air circulation and flowing water cool the rock off so that even at a depth of several hundred meters nothing of the earth's heat can be detected. In Holloch (Switzerland) where passages reach as far as 900 m below the earth's surface, a temperature gradient approximately corresponding to that in the open atmosphere (-1 °C/200 m) dominates in winter. 
Cooling corrosion is climamorphologically active. It attains maximum values in continental regions of the moderate and marginally tropical zones where considerable daily variations are added to the annual ones. Compared with mixing corrosion, how- ever, the effectiveness of cooling corrosion is generally less, and, moreover, limited to the uppermost meters of the rock. 
Thermal water is a special case. Its capacity to corrode rises to high values, as the amounts of CO2 which are released by cooling are occasionally enormous. When the pressure decreases the CO2 can become free spontaneously, especially on emergence at the surface, thereby making the water bubble up: bubbling water. The thermal springs of Budapest created cave systems by cooling corrosion.
