# Project 2: Automatic semantic relation extraction (joint projects with UL FF)

Using TermFrame knowledge base and word embeddings to extract hypernym/hyponym pairs from specialized or general corpora. The goal is to build and visualize a semantic network. Extract non-hierarchical semantic relations using semantically annotated sentences as input.

## Tasks:
Develop a tool which will extract hypernym-hyponym pairs from a domain-specific corpus. 

- The performance of the tool should be evaluated in at least two domains.
- The results should be visualized as a semantic network.
- Bonus points for languages other than English. 

## Task 2:
Develop a tool which will extract new instances of domain-specific semantic relations from the Karst corpus.

- Limitations to a selection of relations
- Bonus points for other domains
- Bonus points for languages other than English.
