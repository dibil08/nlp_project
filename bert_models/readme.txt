Models we used can be found on Google Drive. Here you can also find the ZIP file, that was give to the Linguist from Faculty of Arts for manual annotation

Note however, that due to models using Pickle files and these files saving absolute path references from the computer on which they were fine-tuned,
these models will probably not be usable on any other computer. Because of this, it is best to run the fine-tuning on your local computer in order to get the models.
Instructions for this can be found in the README.md of the project's root directory.
