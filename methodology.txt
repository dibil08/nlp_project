Proposed methodology:

        1. Datasets collection & description (other relationship/ontology building datasets).

                - finding similar/same semantic relations to Karstology in other datasets

        2. Definition of clear evaluation setups for your work, for example:

                - training/fine-tuning on other datasets, testing on karstology

                - using an English model only

                - using a multilingual model for zero-shot transfer learning (e.g., English -> Slovene)

                - definition of manual rules/feature extractors (together with UL FF) for traditional methods usage

                - evaluation of a model fine-tuned on Karstology on a new corpus (prepared by UL FF)

        3. Identification tools (papers with runnable repositories) that you can use for your evaluation setups.

        4. Analysis setup and running, preparing results, for example:

                - reporting on scores for selected evaluation setups (choose correct measures)

                - qualitative analysis of results (UL FF)

                - changing parameters, using different setups/models to provide comparison tables

	5. Writing a final report + additional tests if needed (reserve one week for doing this).
