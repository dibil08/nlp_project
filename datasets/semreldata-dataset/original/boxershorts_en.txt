Boxer shorts (also known as loose boxers or as simply boxers) are a type of undergarment typically worn by men. The term has been used in English since 1944 for all-around-elastic shorts, so named after the shorts worn by boxers, for whom unhindered leg movement ("footwork") is very important. BLABLABLABLA
Reasons for a preference for boxers can be attributed to their variety of styles and design and their general appearance while worn, as well as their ability to provide high levels of natural comfort and freedom relative to other male undergarments. Unlike traditional briefs or the more modern boxer briefs, boxers allow for more freedom in the selection of a fabric type and print design.
