A waistcoat (/ˈwɛskət/ or /ˈweɪstkoʊt/; commonly called a vest in American English, and by some Savile Row tailors[citation needed]) is a sleeveless upper-body garment. It is usually worn over a dress shirt and necktie and below a coat as a part of most men's formal wear. It is also sported as the third piece of the three-piece male business suit.
