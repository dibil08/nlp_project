#text=As with other durian species , the edible flesh emits a distinctive odour that is strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact . Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance ; others find the aroma overpowering and revolting . The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust , and has been described variously as rotten onions , turpentine , and raw sewage . The persistence of its odour has led to the fruit 's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia
