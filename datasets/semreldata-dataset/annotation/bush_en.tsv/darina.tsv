#text=Earlier this month , Bush arranged a $1.2 billion budget for the fence , along with cameras , sensors , satellites and other security measures , to create a " 21st-century " border — but the fence alone is roughly estimated to cost twice that amount . A U. S. poll this week showed that there are more Americans in favor of an increased number of Border Patrol agents , while less then half of those questioned agreed with the fence

#text=According to the BBC , about 10 million Mexicans live in the U. S. , and about four million of them are estimated to be illegal . Though , since illegal immigrants are not registered in any official sense , this number may be much higher , and other figures have circulated in the press . Bush has declared he will attempt to counter " widespread document fraud " , and opposes the idea of granting illegals who work in the U. S. quick citizenship , or amnesty . According to Bush , " There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation , and I look forward to working with Congress to find that middle ground .

#text=Since Bush took office , he said , about 6 million have been intercepted and deported . Mexico previously said it deplored the idea , and considers taking this to the United Nations . The Organization of American States also expressed " deep concerns " over the fence , calling the proposal " a unilateral measure that goes against the spirit of understanding that should characterize how shared problems between neighboring countries are handled and that affects cooperation in the hemisphere . " The outgoing Mexican President Vincente Fox has compared the fence with the Berlin Wall , while President-elect Felipe Calderon thought it was a " grave mistake " , and also that " the fence does n't resolve anything " , causing more casualties along the border . Other politicians in Mexico accused the U. S. of hypocrisy , benefiting from cheap Mexican workers but not allowing them to acquire citizenship
