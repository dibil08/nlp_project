#text=" Heavens ! what a virulent attack ! " replied the prince , not in the least disconcerted by this reception . He had just entered , wearing an embroidered court uniform , knee breeches , and shoes , and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face . He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought , and with the gentle , patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court . He went up to Anna Pavlovna , kissed her hand , presenting to her his bald , scented , and shining head , and complacently seated himself on the sofa
