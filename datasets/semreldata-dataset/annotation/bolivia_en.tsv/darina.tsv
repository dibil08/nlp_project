#text=Evo Morales ' government will be the first to be led by an indigenous president in the nation 's history . Morales ' left of center policies , especially his support for the coca industry will likely not make him a popular Latin American figure for the Bush administration in the United States , who might be afraid of a closer alliance between Morales , Hugo Chávez in Venezuela , Fidel Castro of Cuba , and even the more moderate but still left-of-center Luiz Lula da Silva of Brazil

#text=Morales has commented saying that under his administration there will be " zero cocaine , zero narco-trafficking but not zero coca . " In addition to being against the U. S. policy of coca extermination , Morales is also against many of the neoliberal policies of the past Bolivian governments , including free trade agreements . However he might have some difficulty getting through his new programs as the Movement Toward Socialism party to which he is a member did not win control of the congress
