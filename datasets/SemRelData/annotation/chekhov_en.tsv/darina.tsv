#text=Hearing her name the mongrel had come out from under the work - table , where she slept on the shavings , stretched herself voluptuously and run after her master . The people Luka Alexandritch worked for lived a very long way off , so that , before he could get to any one of them , the carpenter had several times to step into a tavern to fortify himself . Kashtanka remembered that on the way she had behaved extremely improperly . In her delight that she was being taken for a walk she jumped about , dashed barking after the trains , ran into yards , and chased other dogs . The carpenter was continually losing sight of her , stopping , and angrily shouting at her . Once he had even , with an expression of fury in his face , taken her fox - like ear in his fist , smacked her , and said emphatically : " Pla - a - ague take you , you pest !
