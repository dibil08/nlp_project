#text=North Korea first announced it possessed nuclear weapons in 2005 , though because it had not conducted a nuclear test its nuclear capability remained ambiguous . The United States , Japan , China , and South Korea have all urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear program . North Korea released a statement on October 3 saying that it would soon conduct a nuclear test , and also emphasized that it would neither use nuclear weapons first nor aid other countries in nuclear proliferation . The state claimed that it would only use the weapons as a deterrent against the United States and its allies . In 2003 , U. S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said that they " would not tolerate " a nuclear North Korea . China and Japan have also expressed concern
