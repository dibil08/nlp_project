#text=A clementine ( Citrus ×clementina ) is a hybrid between a mandarin and a sweet orange , so named in 1902 . [ 1 ] The exterior is a deep orange colour with a smooth , glossy appearance . Clementines can be separated into 7 to 14 segments . They tend to be very easy to peel , like a tangerine , but are almost always seedless when grown commercially ( unfertilized ) . For this reason they are sometimes known as seedless tangerines ; the clementine is also occasionally referred to as the Moroccan clementine . [ 2 ] They are typically juicy and sweet , with less acid than oranges . [ 1 ] Their oils , like other citrus fruits , contain mostly limonene as well as myrcene , linalool , α-pinene and many complex aromatics .

#text=This variety was introduced into California commercial agriculture in 1914 , though it was grown at the Citrus Research Center ( now part of the University of California , Riverside ) as early as 1909 . [ 6 ] Clementines , usually grown in Algeria , Tunisia , Spain , Portugal , Morocco , Greece , Italy , Israel , Lebanon , Iran and Turkey , have been available in Europe for many years . A market for them in the United States was created when the harsh 1997 winter in Florida devastated domestic orange production , increasing prices and decreasing availability . [ citation needed ] Clementines are typically sold in net bags contained in small wooden or cardboard boxes in United States .
