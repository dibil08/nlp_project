#text=Évariste Gamelin , painter , pupil of David , member of the Section du Pont - Neuf , formerly Section Henri IV , had betaken himself at an early hour in the morning to the old church of the Barnabites , which for three years , since 21st May 1790 , had served as meeting - place for the General Assembly of the Section . The church stood in a narrow , gloomy square , not far from the gates of the Palais de Justice . On the façade , which consisted of two of the Classical orders superimposed and was decorated with inverted brackets and flaming urns , blackened by the weather and disfigured by the hand of man , the religious emblems had been battered to pieces , while above the doorway had been inscribed in black letters the Republican catchword of " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity or Death . " Évariste Gamelin made his way into the nave ; the same vaults which had heard the surpliced clerks of the Congregation of St. Paul sing the divine offices , now looked down on red - capped patriots assembled to elect the Municipal magistrates and deliberate on the affairs of the Section . The Saints had been dragged from their niches and replaced by the busts of Brutus , Jean - Jacques and Le Peltier . The altar had been stripped bare and was surmounted by the Table of the Rights of Man
