#text=Towards the end of November , during a thaw , at nine o'clock one morning , a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed . The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking ; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows

Both were young fellows , both were rather poorly dressed , both had remarkable faces , and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation .

#text=One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven , not tall , with black curling hair , and small , grey , fiery eyes . His nose was broad and flat , and he had high cheek bones ; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent , ironical--it might almost be called a malicious--smile ; but his forehead was high and well formed , and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face . A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor , which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look , and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent , sarcastic smile and keen , self-satisfied bearing . He wore a large fur--or rather astrachan--overcoat , which had kept him warm all night , while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared . His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it--the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy--was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia , from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg

#text=The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow , also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age , slightly above the middle height , very fair , with a thin , pointed and very light coloured beard ; his eyes were large and blue , and had an intent look about them , yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence , of an epileptic subject . His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that ; refined , but quite colourless , except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold . He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe , and wore thick shoes and gaiters , his whole appearance being very un-Russian
