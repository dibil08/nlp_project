#text=Certainly you must all be uneasy that I have not written for so long—so very long . My mother , I am sure , is angry , and Clara will believe that I am passing my time in dissipation , entirely forgetful of the fair angel - image that is so deeply imprinted in my heart and mind . Such , however , is not the case . Daily and hourly I think of you all , and in my sweet dreams the kindly form of my lovely Clara passes before me , and smiles upon me with her bright eyes as she was wont when I appeared among you . Alas , how could I write to you in the distracted mood which has hitherto disturbed my every thought ! Something horrible has crossed my path of life . Dark forebodings of a cruel , threatening , fate spread themselves over me like dark clouds , which no friendly sunbeam can penetrate . Now will I tell you what has befallen me . I must do so , that I plainly see—but if I only think of it , it will laugh out of me like mad . Ah , my dear Lothaire , how shall I begin it ? How shall I make you in any way sensible that that which occurred to me a few days ago could really have such a fatal effect on my life ? If you were here you could see for yourself , but now you will certainly take me for a crazy ghost - seer . In a word , the horrible thing which happened to me , and the painful impression of which I in vain endeavour to escape , is nothing more than this ; that some days ago , namely on the 30th of October , at twelve o'clock at noon , a barometer - dealer came into my room and offered me his wares . I bought nothing , and threatened to throw him down stairs , upon which he took himself off of his own accord

#text=You suspect that only relations of the most peculiar kind , and exerting the greatest influence over my life can give any import to this occurrence , nay , that the person of that unlucky dealer must have a hostile effect upon me . So it is , indeed . I collect myself with all my might , that patiently and quietly I may tell you so much of my early youth as will bring all plainly and clearly in bright images before your active mind . As I am about to begin I fancy that I hear you laughing and Clara saying : " Childish stories indeed ! " Laugh at me I beseech you , laugh with all your heart .

#id=3
#text=Excepting at dinner time I and my brothers and sisters saw my father very little during the day . He was , perhaps , busily engaged at his ordinary occupation . After supper , which , according to the old custom was served up at seven o'clock , we all went with my mother into my father 's work - room , and seated ourselves at the round table . My father smoked tobacco and drank a large glass of beer . Often he told us a number of wonderful stories , and grew so warm over them that his pipe continually went out . I had to light it again , with burning paper , which I thought great sport . Often , too , he would give us picture - books , and sit in his arm - chair silent and thoughtful , puffing out such thick clouds of smoke that we all seemed to be swimming in the clouds . On such evenings as these my mother was very melancholy , and immediately the clock struck nine , she would say : " Now children , to bed—to bed ! The Sandman is coming , I can see . " And certainly on all these occasions I heard something with a heavy , slow step go bouncing up the stairs . That I thought must be the Sandman . Once that dull noise and footstep were particularly fearful , and I asked my mother , while she took us away : " Eh , mamma , who is this naughty Sandman , who always drives us away from papa ? What does he look like ? " " There is no Sandman , dear child , " replied my mother . " When I say the Sandman comes , I only mean that you are sleepy and cannot keep your eyes open , — just as if sand had been sprinkled into them . " This answer of my mother 's did not satisfy me—nay , in my childish mind the thought soon matured itself that she only denied the existence of the Sandman to hinder us from being terrified at him . Certainly I always heard him coming up the stairs . Full of curiosity to hear more of this Sandman , and his particular connection with children , I at last asked the old woman who tended my youngest sister what sort of man he was . " Eh , Natty , " said she , " do you not know that yet ? He is a wicked man , who comes to children when they will not go to bed , and throws a handful of sand into their eyes , so that they start out bleeding from their heads . These eyes he puts in a bag and carries them to the half - moon to feed his own children , who sit in the nest up yonder , and have crooked beaks like owls with which they may pick up the eyes of the naughty human children .

#text=A most frightful image of the cruel Sandman was horribly depicted in my mind , and when in the evening I heard the noise on the stairs , I trembled with agony and alarm . My mother could get nothing out of me , but the cry of " The Sandman , the Sandman ! " which was stuttered forth through my tears . I then ran into the bed - room , where the frightful apparition of the Sandman terrified me during the whole night . I had already grown old enough to perceive that the nurse 's tale about the Sandman and the nest of children in the half - moon could not be quite true , but , nevertheless , this Sandman remained a fearful spectre , and I was seized with the utmost horror , when I heard him not only come up the stairs , but violently force open my father 's room - door and enter . Sometimes he staid away for a long period , but oftener his visits were in close succession . This lasted for years , and I could not accustom myself to the terrible goblin ; the image of the dreadful Sandman did not become more faint . His intercourse with my father began more and more to occupy my fancy . An unconquerable fear prevented me from asking my father about it , but if I—I myself could penetrate the mystery , and behold the wondrous Sandman—that was the wish which grew upon me with years . The Sandman had brought me into the path of the marvellous and wonderful , which so readily finds a domicile in the mind of a child . Nothing was to me more delightful than to read or hear horrible stories of goblins , witches , pigmies , &c . ; but above them all stood the Sandman , whom , in the oddest and most frightful shapes , I was always drawing with chalk or charcoal on the tables , cupboards , and walls . When I was ten years old , my mother removed me from the children 's room into a little chamber , situated in a corridor near my father 's room . Still , as before , we were obliged speedily to take our departure as soon as , on the stroke of nine , the unknown was heard in the house . I could hear in my little chamber how he entered my father 's room , and then it soon appeared to me that a thin vapor of a singular odor diffused itself about the house . Stronger and stronger with my curiosity grew my resolution to form in some manner the Sandman 's acquaintance . Often I sneaked from my room to the corridor , when my mother had passed , but never could I discover any thing , for the Sandman had always gone in at the door when I reached the place where I might have seen him . At last , urged by an irresistible impulse , I resolved to hide myself in my father 's room and await the appearance of the Sandman
