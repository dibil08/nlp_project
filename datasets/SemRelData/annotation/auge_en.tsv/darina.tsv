#text=Eyes are the organs of vision . They detect light and convert it into electro - chemical impulses in neurons . The simplest photoreceptor cells in conscious vision connect light to movement . In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment , regulates its intensity through a diaphragm , focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image , converts this image into a set of electrical signals , and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain . Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms , and 96 % of animal species possess a complex optical system . [ 1 ] Image - resolving eyes are present in molluscs , chordates and arthropods . [ 2
