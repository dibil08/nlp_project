#text=Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski 's bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual . ( The boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it . ) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring . Little Nicholas , who had just waked up in a cold perspiration , sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes . He had awaked from a terrible dream . He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre , wearing helmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch , were leading a huge army . The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vierge . In front was Glory , which was similar to those threads but rather thicker . He and Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously , nearer and nearer to their goal . Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move . And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude
